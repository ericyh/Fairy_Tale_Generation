      "[\"There was once a king's son who told his father that he wished to marry.\", \"'No, no!' said the king; 'you must not be in such a hurry. Wait till you have done some great deed. My father did not let me marry till I had won the golden sword you see me wear.'\", \"'Yes, indeed, I've lived long and been much about in the world, but I have never seen or heard anything of what you ask. Still, if you will wait till to-morrow I may be able to tell you something.'\", \"'Good evening, dear mother,' said he politely.\", \"'Good evening to you, my dear son,' answered the old woman. 'It is lucky for you that you spoke to me or you would have met with a horrible death. But may I ask where are you going?'\", 'This time the water was ready and the girl did not fly away, but she and the prince promised to love each other always. Then they set out for home.', 'At supper that night the queen offered the king all sorts of nice things to eat and drink, but he declared he was not hungry, and went early to bed.', \"The king was delighted to see his son, and had a great many questions to ask and answer; but when he heard that instead of quietly waiting for him at home the prince was starting off to seek a wife he was very angry, and said: 'You may go where you please but I will not leave any of my people with you.'\", 'The crows had hardly done speaking when away they flew. And close upon them followed three pigeons.', 'With that the pigeons flew off and three eagles took their places, and this is what they said:', 'With that they set out on their journey.', \"The prince was so delighted that he could not speak. But the servant said: 'My lord, let me examine this carriage first and then you can get in if I find it is all right; otherwise we had better stay in our own.'\", 'The old king fell into a tremendous rage. He called his Council together and condemned the servant to death.', \"So the prince set off to try to find Lucky Luck. He walked and walked till he got beyond his own country, and he wandered through a wood for three days but did not meet a living being in it. At the end of the third day he came to a river near which stood a large mill. Here he spent the night. When he was leaving next morning the miller asked him: 'My gracious lord, where are you going all alone?'\", 'The prince promised to inquire, and went on his way.', 'The prince said he would do so, and continued his journey.', \"'I am looking for Lucky Luck,' replied the prince.\", 'With that she showed him the way, and the prince went and did just as she had told him. After dinner they lay down to rest.', \"All of a sudden Lucky Luck began to speak and said: 'Tell me, what sort of man are you, for since you came here you have not spoken a word?'\", \"'I am not dumb,' replied the young man, 'but I am that unhappy prince whose faithful servant has been turned to stone, and I want to know how to help him.'\", \"'I have another thing to ask,' said the prince, when he had thanked him. 'In the forest near here is a fine stream but not a fish or other living creature in it. Why is this?'\", \"When he reached the stream it asked if he brought it any good news. 'When I get across I will tell you,' said he. So the stream parted; he walked through and on to the highest part of the bank. He stopped and shouted out:\", \"'Listen, oh stream! Lucky Luck says you will never have any living creature in your waters until someone is drowned in you.'\", 'The miller, too, began to give alms and became a very good man, and in time grew so rich that he hardly knew how much he had.', 'Next morning he was brought bound before the king, who was so pleased with the boy that he gave him a thousand crowns at once. The prisoner was all covered with hair, almost like an animal; and altogether he was so curious to look at that the king locked him up in a strong room and sent out letters of invitation to all the other kings and princes asking them to come and see this wonder.', \"The boy wandered on and on till he came to a large town. Here he took service in the king's palace, and as no one troubled themselves about him he lived quietly on.\", \"When he got beyond the town he took out his golden apple, and when the horse sprang out he swung himself into the saddle. Then he took the silver and the copper apples, and with all these fine soldiers he joined the king's army.\", 'Well, the whole matter might have ended there; but it so happened that the younger princess had fallen in love with the prince, as he had with her. And as he had no jewels with him, he gave her the copper apple and staff.', \"'Yes, your Majesty, it was I,' answered the prince.\", \"'But where did you get your army?'\", \"'If you wish to see it, I can show it you outside the city walls.'\", \"Not long after there was a grand wedding; perhaps they may all be alive still, but I don't know.\", 'The king heard of this and was very angry, and sent for the shepherd to appear before him.', 'The shepherd came and stood before the throne, where the king sat looking very grand and powerful. But however grand or powerful he might be the shepherd did not feel a bit afraid of him.', \"'To my good health!' replied the shepherd.\", \"'To mine, to mine, your Majesty,' was the answer.\", \"'But to mine--to my own,' roared the king, and beat on his breast in a rage.\", 'Then the shepherd ventured to laugh at last; and he laughed so long and so loud that when the Lord Chamberlain came early in the morning, expecting to find only his bones, the tears were still running down his cheeks from laughter.', 'Quite early next morning came the Lord Chamberlain, carrying a lamp and he nearly fell backwards with surprise when he saw the shepherd alive and well. He brought him to the king, whose fury was greater than ever, but who cried:', 'But the shepherd only gave the same answer:', \"'I won't say it till the princess is my wife.'\", 'The shepherd turned hot and cold by turns, but he still persisted:', \"'I will not say it till the princess is my wife.'\", 'The king was much vexed; he drove further on till they came to a splendid castle, all of gold, and then he said:', '\\'Do you see this golden castle? Well, I will give you that too, the silver wood and the golden castle, if only you will say that one thing to me: \"To your good health.\"\\'', \"'No; I will not say it till I have the princess for my wife.'\", '\\'Do you see this diamond pond? I will give you that too, the silver wood and the golden castle and the diamond pond. You shall have them all--all--if you will but say: \"To your good health!\"\\'', 'The shepherd had to shut his staring eyes tight not to be dazzled with the brilliant pond, but still he said:', \"'No, no; I will not say it till I have the princess for my wife.'\", 'Then the king saw that all his efforts were useless, and that he might as well give in, so he said:', '\\'Well, well, it\\'s all the same to me--I will give you my daughter to wife; but, then, you really and truly must say to me: \"To your good health.\"\\'', \"'Of course I'll say it; why should I not say it? It stands to reason that I shall say it then.'\", 'Now the king had everything to make him happy, but he did not enjoy anything because he could not find a bride to his mind.', \"'Have you anywhere seen or heard of the daughter of an emperor, king, or a prince, who is as clever and as handsome as I am, and who would be worthy to be my wife and the queen of my country?'\", \"'Is the island far off, and which is the way to it?'\", \"'It is not near,' was the answer. 'The journey would take ten years, and we do not know the way. And even if we did, what use would that be? The princess is no bride for you.'\", \"'How dare you say so?' cried the king angrily.\", \"'Very good,' replied the king. 'And you, Simon the second, what is your trade?'\", \"'Good,' said the king; 'and Simon the third?'\", \"'Good,' said the king again; 'and what has Simon the fourth learnt?'\", \"'That is very clever of you,' answered the king; 'and what does Simon the fifth do?'\", \"'That sounds very useful,' said the king. 'And now, Simon the sixth, tell me your trade.'\", \"'So be it, then; I give you my royal word.'\", \"'Now,' said the king, 'if you can shoot that bird I will reward you.'\", 'But the wise men were as silent as ever.', \"'What do I think? Why, that your idea is capital, and you shall be rewarded for it. Come, guards, hurry as fast as you can and bring the seventh Simon before me.'\", 'The youngest Simon, who looked very pale and hungry, only nodded his head.', 'When the king heard these words his heart became filled with longing, and he ordered all to be done as Simon wished. Every one ran about to do his bidding; and in next to no time the wonder-ship was laden and ready to start.', \"This polite speech pleased the princess very much. She went to the king and said: 'Dear father, some merchants have arrived with the most splendid wares. Pray allow me to go to their ship and choose out what I like.'\", \"The shepherd stood wondering how the poor snake could escape, for the wind was blowing the flames that way, and soon that tree would be burning like the rest. Suddenly the snake cried: 'O shepherd! for the love of heaven save me from this fire!'\", \"'When we are come to my father's house,' said his own snake to him, 'he will reward you with anything you like to ask--silver, gold, jewels, or whatever on this earth is most precious; but take none of all these things, ask rather to understand the language of beasts. He will refuse it to you a long time, but in the end he will grant it to you.'\", \"'Now you know the language of beasts, go in peace; but, if you value your life, beware lest you tell any one of it, else you will immediately die.'\", \"Now amongst the dogs there was one so old that he had only two teeth left in his head, and he spoke to the wolves, saying: 'So long as I have my two teeth still in my head, I will let no harm be done to my master.'\", \"All this the master heard and understood, and as soon as morning dawned he ordered all the dogs to be killed excepting the old dog. The farm servants wondered at this order, and exclaimed: 'But surely, sir, that would be a pity?'\", 'Meanwhile they had reached home, and before getting down from his horse the man called for a coffin to be brought; and when it was there he placed it in front of the house, and said to his wife:', ' The Boy Who Could Keep A Secret', 'However, there came a day at last when it slipped in quite easily. The child was so delighted that he could hardly believe his eyes, so he tried it seven times, and each time it slipped in more easily than before. But pleased though the boy was, he determined not to tell anyone about it, particularly not his mother, who never could keep anything from her neighbours.', \"'Oh, mother, I had such a nice dream last night,' said he; 'but I can't tell it to anybody.'\", \"'You can tell it to me,' she answered. 'It must have been a nice dream, or you wouldn't look so happy.'\", \"'I want to know what it was, and know it I will,' cried she, 'and I will beat you till you tell me.'\", \"'Yes, if my mother will let me,' answered the boy. And the king bade the servant go back to the mother and say that if she would give her boy to him, he should live in the palace and marry his prettiest daughter as soon as he was a man.\", 'Then he climbed into the coach and was driven away.', \"After they had gone some distance the king said: 'Why were you crying so bitterly in the garden just now?'\", \"'And what did she do that for?' asked the king again.\", \"'And why wouldn't you tell it to her?'\", \"'And won't you tell it to me either?' asked the king in surprise.\", \"'No, not even to you, your Majesty,' replied he.\", \"'Oh, I am sure you will when we get home,' said the king smiling, and he talked to him about other things till they came to the palace.\", \"'I have brought you such a nice present,' he said to his daughters, and as the boy was very pretty they were delighted to have him and gave him all their best toys.\", \"'He will tell me,' answered the eldest princess; but the boy only shook his head.\", \"'He will tell me,' said the second girl.\", \"'He will tell me,' cried the youngest, who was the prettiest too.\", 'The king was very sorry when he heard this, for he loved the boy dearly; but he thought it would never do to keep anyone near him who would not do as he was bid. So he commanded his servants to take him away and not to let him enter the palace again until he had come to his right senses.', 'Meanwhile the two eldest princesses had become women, and had married two powerful kings who ruled over great countries across the sea. The youngest one was old enough to be married too, but she was very particular, and turned up her nose at all the young princes who had sought her hand.', \"'Give him to me, I'm sure he will tell me the secret; or, if not, I have a daughter who is like the Morning Star, and he is sure to tell it to her.'\", \"'You will tell my daughter,' said the king, smiling.\", \"'I have brought him from the gallows,' answered the king; rather vexed at his daughter's words, as never before had she consented to speak to any man.\", \"'You will tell another tale,' replied the king, 'when you ask him his secret. After all he is no better than a servant.'\", \"'That is nothing to me,' said the princess, 'for I love him. He will tell his secret to me, and will find a place in the middle of my heart.'\", \"'My angel,' he answered, 'be wise, and ask no questions, if you wish to get safely back to your father's palace; I have kept my secret all these years, and do not mean to tell it now.'\", \"'There is some magic about this,' said the king.\", 'So the princess did exactly as the youth had bidden her; and no sooner had she spoken than the king ordered the tower to be pulled down, and the prisoner brought before him.', 'Once upon a time there lived an emperor who had three sons. They were all fine young men, and fond of hunting, and scarcely a day passed without one or other of them going out to look for game.', 'For many hours he rode up and down the mountain, but saw nothing, and at last, tired of waiting, he went back to the mill. Here he found an old woman sitting, whom he greeted pleasantly.', \"'Good morning to you, little mother,' he said; and the old woman answered: 'Good morning, my son.'\", \"'Tell me, little mother,' went on the prince, 'where shall I find my hare?'\", \"'My son,' replied the old woman, 'that was no hare, but a dragon who has led many men hither, and then has eaten them all.' At these words the prince's heart grew heavy, and he cried, 'Then my brothers must have come here, and have been eaten by the dragon!'\", \"'Will you not come with me out of this dreadful place?' said the young man.\", \"'He took me prisoner, too,' answered she, 'and I cannot shake off his chains.'\", 'So the prince went home, and the old woman remained in the mill, and as soon as the dragon returned she said to him:', \"'Where have you been all this time--you must have travelled far?'\", \"'Will you take care of my sheep?' said the emperor, when the young man knelt before him.\", \"'To-morrow,' he said, when he had finished, 'you shall go with the shepherd to the lake, and then you shall kiss him on the forehead as he wishes.'\", \"'Will you really send me, your only child, to that dreadful place, from which most likely I shall never come back?'\", 'Merrily the shepherd blew on his pipes as he marched at the head of his flock, only stopping every now and then to say to the weeping girl at his side:', \"'Do not cry so, Heart of Gold; trust me and fear nothing.' And so they reached the lake.\", \"'Now,' cried the prince, holding the sparrow in his hand, 'now you shall tell me where I can find my brothers.'\", \"'What do you want?' asked she.\", 'Then the old man took a bag and filled it with food and money, and throwing it over his shoulders, bade his wife farewell.', \"'My misery has brought me here,' replied the old man; 'I have no child, and all our lives my wife and I have longed for one. So I left my home, and went out into the world, hoping that somewhere I might find what I was seeking.'\", \"When they were close to the cottage where they lived he laid the child in a pail that was standing near the door, and ran into the house, crying: 'Come quickly, wife, quickly, for I have brought you a daughter, with hair of gold and eyes like stars!'\", 'So in this fashion the old woman was brought to court.', \"'You have declared that you can bring hither the maiden from the wood?' said the emperor, who was seated on his throne.\", \"'Yes, your Majesty, and I will keep my word,' said she.\", \"'Then bring her at once,' said the emperor.\", \"'If you would only show me how to do it, perhaps I should understand,' said she.\", \"One day he was sitting under a bush playing so sweetly that you might easily have mistaken the notes for those of a bird, when an old man passed by. 'What trade do you wish to follow, my son?' he asked in a friendly voice, stopping as he did so in front of the youth.\", \"'But where am I to get the pipes from?' asked the youth.\", \"'I shall soon indeed be a dead man if you do not help me,' answered Tiidu, 'for my strength is going fast.'\", \"'Where have you come from?' said the captain, when Tiidu was brought up on board the ship.\", 'Tiidu did not like this advice--he was afraid that the people would laugh at him; and, besides, it was long since he had touched his pipes--but the old man persisted, and at last Tiidu did as he was told.', 'Once upon a time there lived a king and a queen who had one son. The king loved the boy very much, but the queen, who was a wicked woman, hated the sight of him; and this was the more unlucky for, when he was twelve years old, his father died, and he was left alone in the world.', \"One day, when his mourning was over, he gave orders that everything should be made ready for a grand hunt. The queen pretended to be greatly delighted that he was going to amuse himself once more, and declared that she would accompany him. 'No, mother, I cannot let you come,' he answered; 'the ground is rough, and you are not strong.' But he might as well have spoken to the winds: when the horn was sounded at daybreak the queen was there with the rest.\", \"By-and-by the boy grew into a man, as boys will, and then the oldest of the fairies said to her sisters: 'Now I will marry him, and he shall be really your brother.' So the young king married the fairy, and they lived happily together in the castle; but though he loved his wife he still longed to see the world.\", \"At length this longing grew so strong on him that he could bear it no more; and, calling the fairies together, he said to them: 'Dear wife and sisters, I must leave you for a time, and go out and see the world. But I shall think of you often, and one day I shall come back to you.'\", \"By-and-by the old man came back and they all sat down to dinner. When they had finished the magician said: 'Now, my son, tell me what you will have as the reward of your courage?'\", \"'Give me the horse that stands in the third stall of your stable,' answered the youth. 'For I have a long way to go before I get home, and my feet will not carry me so far.'\", \"'Ah! my son,' replied the magician, 'it is the best horse in my stable that you want! Will not anything else please you as well?'\", \"'Do not sell me, but ask the king to take me to his stable, and feed me there; then his other horses will become just as beautiful as I.'\", 'So the young man did as he was told, and brought the horse back to the king.', \"'Oh, I will put that right,' said the magician; and taking the gallows, he tore it up and flung it into the air, and no one knows where it came down. 'Who has ordered you to be hanged?' asked he.\", \"At length they wandered into a forest, and being very tired, sat down under a tree to eat some bread that they had brought with them. When they had finished the queen said: 'My son, I am thirsty; fetch me some water.'\", 'The second man, hearing the signal, leapt the ditch in confidence, and was met by the same fate, and in a few minutes eleven of the robbers lay dead, and there remained only the captain.', 'With the dawn they were both awake again, and found that, instead of the cave which they had come to the night before, they now were in a splendid castle, full of beautiful rooms. The prince went round all these and carefully locked them up, bidding his mother take care of the keys while he was hunting.', \"'I am no robber,' answered the prince. 'I am the son of a king, and I have killed all the band. If you do not open to me at once I will break in the door, and your head shall go to join the others.'\", \"He waited a little, but the door remained shut as tightly as before. Then he just put his shoulder to it, and immediately the wood began to crack. When the giant found that it was no use keeping it shut, he opened it, saying: 'I see you are a brave youth. Let there be peace between us.'\", \"'Here, you had better keep them! You may find them useful!'\", \"Weeping, the blind youth felt his way to the giant's house, and told him all the story.\", \"The giant was full of pity for the poor young man, but inquired anxiously what he had done with the eyes. The prince drew them out of his pocket, and silently handed them to the giant, who washed them well, and then put them back in the prince's head. For three days he lay in utter darkness; then the light began to come back, till soon he saw as well as ever.\", \"'Never mind, my friend,' said the giant, 'I will get it back for you.' And he sent for the monkey who was his head servant.\", 'Presently up spoke the silver-haired Father Martin.', '\\'\"Away from me, monster,\" I answered, \"I will have nothing to do with you.\"', 'This grieved the tender heart of his pretty daughter, who loved him dearly, and was the comfort of his life.', \"'Do not be annoyed, dear wife. I have a good piece of business in hand which may turn out well for us.'\", \"'You with a good business?' cried she, 'you are good for nothing but talk!'\", \"'I am making my will,' said he, 'that when my hour comes my house may be in order.'\", \"'Why out of it?' said Peter. 'What has the world been doing to you?'\", \"'Where is the good, father?' said he. 'You can give me neither help nor comfort.'\", \"'Your story is strange indeed,' said he.

He might well take your part, and be glad to have you for his son-in-law.'\", \"'If you will take my advice,' said he, 'I promise you that you shall marry this maiden whom you love so much, and that before you are many days older.'\", 'Then the man vanished, and the youth awoke.', 'He sent a message to the king to beg for an audience, and received a reply that he was to go into the great hall, where he would find his Majesty.', \"The king was at dinner with his court when the young man entered, and he signed to him to come near. The youth bowed low, and then gazed in surprise at the crowd of little black creatures who were running about the floor, and even on the table itself. Indeed, they were so bold that they snatched pieces of food from the King's own plate, and if he drove them away, tried to bite his hands, so that he could not eat his food, and his courtiers fared no better.\", \"'What sort of animals are these?' asked the youth of one of the ladies sitting near him.\", \"'The princess and the kingdom,' said the young man.\", \"'Why do you look so astonished?' he asked.\", \"'I was wondering why you shook the boughs so fiercely,' answered the prince.\", \"'I was wondering why you were filling the basket,' replied the prince.\", \"'Oh, certainly,' answered the prince; 'but, all the same, I would rather go and seek the land where there is no death at all.'\", \"'It is the capital city of the Blue Kingdom,' replied the man, 'but the king himself is dead, and his daughter is now the ruler.'\", \"The queen did all she could to persuade him to stay, but as her words proved useless, at length she gave it up.

When it was over, he said to the prince:\", 'Now there dwelt, not far from the palace, an old man who had three sons.

When they were all grown up, the eldest told his father that he was tired of leading such a quiet life, and that he meant to go away and see the world.', \"'Not I, indeed!' answered he; 'why I have scarcely enough for myself. If you want food you must earn it.' And the beggar went on.\", \"Besides the pleasure of seeing the world, the youth was very anxious to discover what had become of his brothers, and he determined to trace, as far as he could, the way that they must have gone. He followed the road that led from his father's cottage to the hill, where he sat down to rest, saying to himself: 'I am sure my brothers must have stopped here, and I will do the same.'\", \"With a light heart the young man awaited the return of the ogress. When she came in she looked carefully round, and then said to him: 'You did not do that quite alone. However, as the floor is clean I will leave your head on.'\", \"That night the young man slept soundly in his corner, and in the morning the ogress told him that his work that day would be to slay one of her great oxen, to cook its heart, and to make drinking cups of its horns, before she returned home 'There are fifty oxen,' added she, 'and you must guess which of the herd I want killed. If you guess right, to-morrow you shall be free to go where you will, and you shall choose besides three things as a reward for your service. But if you slay the wrong ox your head shall pay for it.'\", 'When the sun rose the ogress awoke the young man, and called to him to choose any three things out of her house.', \"'I choose,' answered he, 'the chest which stands at the foot of your bed; whatever lies on the top of the bed, and whatever is under the side of the cave.'\", \"'You did not choose those things by yourself, my friend,' said the ogress; 'but what I have promised, that will I do.'\", 'And then she gave him his reward.', 'For many years they all lived happily together, and then the queen fell ill, and knew that she would never get better.', \"And the daughter listened, and said softly to her mother: 'Are you speaking the truth now?'\", \"'What is your name, madam?' asked he, much touched by this sad story.\", 'The minister then conducted the mother and daughter back to the ship; the anchor was raised, the sails spread, and a fair wind was behind them.', 'The prince looked at her and was rather disappointed. The maiden was pretty enough, but not much out of the common.', \"'Oh, you must not wonder at her pale face and heavy eyes,' said the queen hastily, for she saw what was passing in his mind.

'Tell me who you are, and where you come from?'\", \"'What shall we eat now, my friends, as there is no more man?'\", \"'What shall we eat now?' asked the wolf again, when he had recovered from his surprise.\", \"'We must eat the smallest of us,' repeated the bear, stretching out a paw towards the hare; but the hare was not a hare for nothing, and before the paw had touched her, she had darted deep into the wood.\", 'These thoughts flashed quickly through his head, and he said hastily:', \"'Dear brothers, would it not be better for us to live together as comrades, and everyone to hunt for the common dinner? Is not my plan a good one?'\", \"'What are you looking at?' he asked in a trembling voice.\", \"'So I did; but though I have searched through the whole forest, there is not a single tree that is as good as this. I am very sorry to put you out, but really it is not my fault.

'The best place is for you both to hide in the big oven, and when the soldiers have gone by I will let you out.'\", \"'Why it is more splendid than my own!' exclaimed the king, looking round on all the beautiful things that filled the hall. But why are there no servants?'\", \"'What do you want?' asked the old man who opened it. And the youth told him how his father had turned him out of his house because he was so lazy and stupid, and he needed shelter for the night.\", \"'That you shall have,' replied the man; 'but to-morrow I shall give you some work to do, for you must know that I am the chief herdsman of the king.'\", 'The youth made no answer to this. He felt, if he was to be made to work after all, that he might as well have stayed where he was.

'He gave them to me to look after, but I knew I could not do it, so I drove them straight to you. Now make the best of your good fortune, and kill them and hang them up at once.'\", \"'What are you talking about?' cried the father, pale with horror. 'We should certainly both be put to death if I did any such thing.'\", \"'Where are the pigs?' asked he.\", \"'You have made up that story very well,' replied the herdsman.\", \"'No, it is the real truth; come with me and I'll prove it.' And they went together to the spot, and there sure enough were the points of the tails sticking up out of the water. The herdsman laid hold of the nearest, and pulled at it with all his might, but it was no use, for the stone and the rope held them all fast. He called to the young man to help him, but the two did not succeed any better than the one had done.\", \"'Yes, your story was true after all; it is a wonderful thing,' said the herdsman.

Now let us return home, for it is time for supper.\", \"At last, however, the sheep seemed tired of running about, and then the youth managed to gather them together, and drove them, as before, straight to his father's house.\", \"'Give up these bad ways and take them back to your master,' said he.\", \"'No, no,' answered the youth; 'I am not so stupid as that! We will kill them and have them for dinner.'\", \"'You will lose your life if you do,' replied the father.\", \"'That is nothing but a lie from beginning to end,' said the herdsman.\", \"'No, it is as true as that there is a sun in heaven,' answered the young man.\", \"'Then give me a proof of it,' cried his master.\", \"'Do you hear?' asked the youth.\", \"'Yes, I hear; you have spoken the truth, and I cannot blame you for what has happened.

But, before they started on the journey, the wife whispered to her husband: 'Take care to jump over the threshold as quick as you can, or it will be the worse for you.'\", 'The young man listened to her words, and sprang over the threshold like an arrow from a bow; and it was well he did, for, no sooner was he on the other side, than his father-in-law threw a great hammer at him, which would have broken both his legs, if it had only touched them.', ' How Some Wild Animals Became Tame Ones', \"'I had not thought of that,' said the bear, whose face turned white, only nobody could see it.

He had no idea where the golden hen might be, or even, if he discovered that, how he was to get to her. But there was nothing for it but to do the king's bidding, and he felt that the sooner he left the palace the better. So he went home and put some food into a bag, and then set forth, hoping that some accident might show him which path to take.\", 'After walking for several hours he met a fox, who seemed inclined to be friendly, and the boy was so glad to have anyone to talk to that he sat down and entered into conversation.', \"'Where are you going?' asked the fox.\", \"'I have got to find a golden hen who has lost a feather out of her tail,' answered the boy; 'but I don't know where she lives or how I shall catch her!'\", 'The boy was delighted at this news, and they walked on all day together, the fox in front, and the boy behind. When evening came they lay down to sleep, and put the knapsack under their heads for a pillow.', \"'I think it would be best for me to enter and steal the hens,' said the fox; but this did not please the boy at all.\", \"'No, it is my business, so it is right that I should go,' answered he.\", \"'You will find it a very difficult matter to get hold of the hens,' replied the fox.\", \"'Oh, nothing is likely to happen to me,' returned the boy.\", \"'Well, go then,' said the fox, 'but be careful not to make any mistake. Steal only the hen which has the feather missing from her tail, and leave the others alone.'\", \"'You shall never, never, have my hen till you bring me back my sister who was carried off by a giant to his castle, which is a long way off.'\", 'Slowly and sadly the youth left the palace and told his story to his friends, who were waiting outside the gate, how he had actually held the hen three times in his arms and had lost her.', \"'I knew that we should not get off so easily,' said the fox, shaking his head; 'but there is no more time to waste. Let us set off at once in search of the sister. Luckily, I know the way.'\", 'They walked on for many days, till at length the fox, who, as usual, was going first, stopped suddenly.', \"'The giant's castle is not far now,' he said, 'but when we reach it you two must remain outside while I go and fetch the princess. Directly I bring her out you must both catch hold of her tight, and get away as fast as you can; while I return to the castle and talk to the giants--for there are many of them--so that they may not notice the escape of the princess.'\", \"A few minutes later they arrived at the castle, and the fox, who had often been there before, slipped in without difficulty. There were several giants, both young and old, in the hall, and they were all dancing round the princess. As soon as they saw the fox they cried out: 'Come and dance too, old fox; it is a long time since we have seen you.'\", 'So the fox stood up, and did his steps with the best of them; but after a while he stopped and said:', \"'I know a charming new dance that I should like to show you; but it can only be done by two people. If the princess will honour me for a few minutes, you will soon see how it is done.'\", \"'Here, in my arms,' replied the fox. 'Don't be afraid; she is quite safe.' And he waited until he thought that his comrades had gained a good start, and put at least five or six mountains between themselves and the giants. Then he sprang through the door, calling, as he went: 'The maiden is here; take her if you can!'\", \"At these words the giants understood that their prize had escaped, and they ran after the fox as fast as their great legs could carry them, thinking that they should soon come up with the fox, who they supposed had the princess on his back. The fox, on his side, was far too clever to choose the same path that his friends had taken, but would in and out of the forest, till at last even HE was tired out, and fell fast asleep under a tree. Indeed, he was so exhausted with his day's work that he never heard the approach of the giants, and their hands were already stretched out to seize his tail when his eyes opened, and with a tremendous bound he was once more beyond their reach. All the rest of the night the fox ran and ran; but when bright red spread over the east, he stopped and waited till the giants were close upon him. Then he turned, and said quietly: 'Look, there is the Sister of the Sun!'\", 'The giants raised their eyes all at once, and were instantly turned into pillars of stone. The fox then made each pillar a low bow, and set off to join his friends.', \"'It is true--every word of it,' answered the boy; and went on to tell that the day and even the hour were fixed when his bride was to come and seek him.\", 'The word was given for him to mount the steps which led to the top of the cask, when, suddenly, some men were seen running with all their might, crying as they went that a large ship with its sails spread was making straight for the city. No one knew what the ship was, or whence it came; but the king declared that he would not have the boy burned before its arrival, there would always be time enough for that.', \"'No, no; I don't know you,' answered the youth, without raising his eyes.\", \"'Don't you know me NOW?' asked she.\", \"'No, I don't know you--I don't know you,' he replied, with the manner of a man whom fear had driven mad.\", \"'I shall marry him to-morrow,' ended she; and ordered the preparations to be set on foot at once.\", 'He did not keep them long, but they saw by his face that nothing good awaited them.', 'This sounded much more difficult than what he had done before, and he turned in despair to the Sister of the Sun.', 'And the young man did what he was told, and left the forest looking exactly as it had done before.', 'So no wonder the youth trembled and turned pale when he heard what lay before him.', \"But the woman only shook her head. 'No, I know nothing of her,' said she.\", \"'Let me in, I pray you, dear mother,' cried he. And the door opened in front of him. 'Your sister has sent you this letter,' he said, and added quickly: 'O mother! can you tell me anything of the Sister of the Sun?'\", \"'Let me in, I pray you, dear mother,' cried he. And as he entered he added: 'Here is a letter from your sister and--can you tell me anything of the Sister of the Sun?'\", \"'My good men, what are you fighting about?' said he. 'That cloth does not look worth much!'\", \"'Let me put it round me for a moment,' said the youth, 'and then I will tell you whose it ought to be!'\", 'The brothers were pleased with this idea, and gave him the stuff; but the moment he had thrown it over his shoulder he disappeared as completely as if he had never been there at all.', \"'What is the matter?' asked he, stopping in front of them.\", \"'If this cloth is spread on a table,' answered they, 'the table is instantly covered with the most delicious food; and we each want to have it.'\", \"'Let me try the table-cloth,' said the youth, 'and I will tell you whose it ought to be.'\", \"'Ah! you may think so,' said one, 'but a blow from one end of this stick will kill a man, while a touch from the other end will bring him back to life. You won't easily find another stick like that!'\", \"'No; that is true,' answered the young man. 'Let me just look at it, and I will tell you whose it ought to be.'\", 'The men were pleased with the idea, and handed him the staff.', \"'Why can't you leave that pair of old shoes alone?' said he. 'Why, you could not walk a yard in them!'\", \"'That sounds very clever,' said the youth. 'Let me try them, and then I shall be able to tell you whose they ought to be.'\", 'The idea pleased the men, and they handed him the shoes; but the moment they were on his feet he cried:', 'The fairies looked at him, and all shook their heads at once.', \"'He is a beautiful boy, and it is a great pity; but what IS to happen WILL happen,' said they.

If we could save him we would; but that is beyond our power.'\", \"'That is a dog, prince,' answered the page.\", \"'Well, bring me one like it, and we will see which can run the faster.' And he watched the dog till it had disappeared round the corner.\", 'Years went by, and the boy and the dog played together till the boy grew tall and strong. The time came at last when he sent a message to his father, saying:', \"And again the king listened to his wishes, and he and his dog were carried in a ship to the other side of the river, which was so broad here it might almost have been the sea.

Never was any prince so happy as he, and he rode and rode till at length he came to a king's palace.\", \"'What are you doing here?' said the youth, one day.\", \"'We spend our whole time climbing up the walls of the palace, trying to reach the windows of the princess,' answered the young men; 'but, as yet, no one has reached within ten feet of them.'\", \"'Oh, let me try too,' cried the prince; 'but to-morrow I will wait and see what you do before I begin.\", \"Then one of the young men ran straight to the king's palace, and said: 'The wall has been climbed, and the prize is won!'\", \"After a little while the prince said to his wife: 'My life is in the hands of three creatures--a crocodile, a serpent, and a dog.'\", 'But the prince would not listen to her.', 'So the prince told her the whole story, and of the impossible task given him by the crocodile.', '\\'How can a sand hole remain full of water?\\' asked he. \\'Of course, it will all run through. The crocodile called it a \"chance\"; but he might as well have dragged me into the river at once. He said truly that I cannot escape him.\\'', \"'Yes, certainly, grandfather,' replied the fox, 'if you have patience to suffer what I suffered.'\", \"'Of course I can,' replied the bear, 'what nonsense you talk!

If you give me leave to go home for a few days I'd be glad.' 'Very well,' said he, 'I will do that, and whenever you feel inclined to return, only mention your wish when you lie down at night.' The next morning when she awoke she found herself in her own old chamber in her father's palace. She rang the bell, and in a short time she had her mother and father and married sisters about her, and they laughed till they cried for joy at finding her safe back again.\", \"So they all persuaded her to do that, and she promised she would; and after eight days she felt so great a longing to see her husband again that she made the wish the same night, and when she woke three hours after, she was in her husband's palace, and he himself was watching over her.

Not very far off was a farm-house, so he went there, and knocked at the door, and the farmer and his wife begged him to come in, and share their breakfast.\", \"'Ah, you have a gun,' said the farmer as the young man placed it in a corner.

For a long time all went well; the young man got up very early in the morning, and worked hard all day, and at the end of every week his father counted up the money they had made, and rubbed his hands with delight, as he saw how big the pile of gold in the strong iron chest was becoming. 'It will soon be full now, and I shall have to buy a larger one,' he said to himself, and so busy was he with the thought of his money, that he did not notice how bright his son's face had grown, nor how he sometimes started when he was spoken to, as if his mind was far away.\", 'Though very pleased at the thought of becoming such a rich man--for the brothers had never cared much for each other--the younger would rather have stayed where he was, for he soon got tired of the country, and longed for a town life. However, this he kept to himself, and made the best of things, working hard like his brother before him.', \"Full of this idea she walked up the marble staircase, and entered the little room where her sister-in-law sat, making clothes for her children. The bride seemed full of interest in the houses, and asked a great many questions about them, so that her new relations liked her much better than they expected, and hoped they might be good friends. However, as soon as she reached home, she went straight to her husband, and told him that he must get back those houses from his brother, as they would exactly suit her, and she could easily make them into a palace as fine as the king's. But her husband only told her that she might buy houses in some other part of the town, for she could not have those, as he had long since made a gift of them to his brother, who had lived there for many years past.\", \"'You have killed our father, do you see? do you see?' cried two young men, 'and you will come with us this instant before the judge, and answer for it.'\", \"'This is the wretch who killed our father,' they said, 'and we demand that he should die also.'\", 'The young men looked at each other, and slowly shook their heads.', \"'We will pay the fine,' said they, and the judge nodded.\", 'So the poor man rode the mule home, and brought back to his family enough money to keep them in comfort to the end of their days.', \"'Your property, certainly,' answered the son, and his father nodded.\", \"'And you?' asked the old man of the girl, who stood by her brother.\", \"'I will have blessing,' she answered, and her father gave her much blessing.\", \"'I am going away from you,' she said to her children, in a faint voice; 'but first, my son, choose which you will have: blessing or property.'\", \"'I will have blessing,' said the girl; and her mother gave her much blessing, and that night she died.\", 'When the days of mourning were ended, the brother bade his sister put outside the hut all that belonged to his father and his mother. So the girl put them out, and he took them away, save only a small pot and a vessel in which she could clean her corn.

Suddenly he was awakened by something wet and salt falling on his face.\", \"'Then climb up the tree and see what it is,' and the slave climbed up, and came back and told his master that a beautiful girl was sitting up there, and that it must have been her tears which had fallen on the face of the king's son.\", \"'Why was she crying?' inquired the prince.\", \"'I cannot tell--I did not dare to ask her; but perhaps she would tell you.' And the master, greatly wondering, climbed up the tree.\", \"'Are you a woman, or a spirit of the woods?'\", \"'Then why do you cry?' he persisted.\", \"'Come home with me,' said the prince; 'it is not very far. Come home to my father and mother. I am a king's son.'\", \"'Then why are you here?' she said, opening her eyes and staring at him.\", \"At that she began to cry again, and told the king's son all that had befallen her since the death of her mother.\", \"The girl could scarcely believe her good fortune, and, in gratitude for all the kindness shown her, was so useful and pleasant to her husband's parents that they soon loved her.\", 'By and bye a baby was born to her, and soon after that the prince was sent on a journey by his father to visit some of the distant towns of the kingdom, and to set right things that had gone wrong.', \"'In the forest,' answered the man, and the cruel brother guessed at once it must be his sister.\", 'A great rage took possession of his soul as he thought of the girl whom he had tried to ruin being after all so much better off than himself, and he vowed that he would work her ill. Therefore that very afternoon he made his way to the palace and asked to see the king.', 'When he was admitted to his presence, he knelt down and touched the ground with his forehead, and the king bade him stand up and tell wherefore he had come.', \"'I am a dead woman,' she said to herself, and stayed quite still, for indeed she was too frightened to move.

Only no one dared to speak to him of his wife and son.', 'At last one morning, after the girl had been lying awake all night thinking of her husband, she said to her friend the snake:', \"'Yes, thus it must be; go and bid farewell to my father and mother, but if they offer you a present, see that you take nothing but my father's ring and my mother's casket.'\", \"'Why do you want the ring and casket so much? Who has told you of them?'\", \"'Oh, nobody; it is just my fancy,' answered she. But the old snakes shook their heads and replied:\", \"'Not so; it is our son who told you, and, as he said, so it must be. If you need food, or clothes, or a house, tell the ring and it will find them for you. And if you are unhappy or in danger, tell the casket and it will set things right.' Then they both gave her their blessing, and she picked up her baby and went her way.\", 'In a few minutes the whole procession came up, and she stepped forward and begged them to come in and rest.', \"'You have ridden far; eat first, and drink, for you must be hungry and thirsty, and then I will tell you my news.'\", \"'What is the matter with me?' she thought, but somehow or other she managed to reach the hut, and threw herself down in a corner, where she slept so soundly that for days no one was able to wake her.\", \"'But what sort of a tree is it, and how did it get here?' he asked of the attendants he had with him.

Two of his eyes closed, and Peronnik sang gently. In a moment a third eye shut, and Peronnik sang on. The lid of a fourth eye dropped heavily, and then those of the fifth and the sixth. The black man was asleep altogether.', \"'I was waiting for you to help me do so,' answered she. 'Come near, that I may get up behind you.'\", \"'But if I kill him, how am I to get the golden bowl and the diamond lance that are hidden in the cellar without a key?' rejoined Peronnik.\", \"'And how did you manage to catch him?' asked the giant.\", \"'You know my brother, then?' inquired the giant. 'Tell me why he sent you here.'\", \"The king's son followed what the raven told him and that night he had meat of each meat, and drink of each drink, warm water for his feet, and a soft bed to lie in.\", \"'What reward wilt thou give me if I put it back in the bundle?' asked the giant.\", \"'What reward dost thou ask?' answered the king's son.\", \"'The first boy thou hast when he is seven years old,' said the giant.\", 'The queen listened in silence to his tale, and after he had finished, she only said:', 'The king glanced at his wife, who nodded, so he answered:', \"'If your father had that stick, what would he do with it?' asked he.\", \"'If my father had that stick, he would beat the dogs and cats that steal the king's meat,' replied the boy.\", \"'If thy father had that rod, what would he do with it?' asked the giant.\", \"'He would beat the dogs and cats that break the king's glasses,' answered the boy.\", 'But though his parents wept bitterly and fancied the child was suffering all kinds of dreadful things, the giant treated him like his own son, though he never allowed him to see his daughters. The boy grew to be a big boy, and one day the giant told him that he would have to amuse himself alone for many hours, as he had a journey to make. So the boy wandered to the top of the castle, where he had never been before. There he paused, for the sound of music broke upon his ears, and opening a door near him, he beheld a girl sitting by the window, holding a harp.', 'Then they parted, and on the morrow, as the girl had said, the giant called his three daughters to him, and likewise the young prince to whom he spoke.', \"'Alas!

'No matter what happens, I'll not go out to-night in such weather as this.'\", \"'Well, then, it will be the worse for yourself,' said the old woman.\", \"The young man lay down in a bed which stood near, but he dared not go to sleep: and it was better that he didn't, for the robbers came, and the old woman said that a young fellow who was a stranger had come there, and she had not been able to get him to go away again.\", \"'Yes,' said they, 'if you have a mind to take to the trade that we follow, you may have a place here.'\", \"'It's all the same to me what trade I follow,' said the youth, 'for when I came away from home my father gave me leave to take to any trade I fancied.'\", \"'Yes,' said the boy, for he thought that was a trade which would not take long to learn.\", 'When the man came with the ox and saw the shoe, he was quite vexed at having been so stupid as to leave the fellow to it lying where it was, instead of bringing it on with him.', \"'I will just run back again and fetch it now,' he said to himself, 'and then I shall take back a pair of good shoes to the old woman, and she may perhaps throw a kind word to me for once.'\", 'So he went and searched and searched for the other shoe for a long, long time, but no shoe was to be found, and at last he was forced to go back with the one which he had.', \"'Well, that will not be a very hard thing to do,' thought the youth.\", 'This time he took with him a rope and put it under his arms and tied himself up to a tree, which hung over the road that the man would have to take. So the man came with his ox, and when he saw the body hanging there he felt a little queer.', \"'What a hard lot yours must have been to make you hang yourself!' said he. 'Ah, well! you may hang there for me; I can't breathe life into you again.'\", 'So on he went with his ox. Then the youth sprang down from the tree, ran by a short cut and got before him, and once more hung himself up on a tree in the road before the man.', 'Once more the youth did just as he had done twice already; jumped down from the tree, ran by a short cut through the wood, and again hanged himself in the very middle of the road before him.', \"'You were always a hard man,' said the youth, 'and hard you are still if you refuse to let your own son come into your house.'\", \"'Are you my son?' said the man.\", \"'Do you not know me again then?' said the youth.\", \"Then he recognised him and said, 'But what trade have you taken to that has made you such a great man in so short a time?'\", \"'You must go to the Governor and beg for his daughter--there is no help,' said the youth.\", \"'But I dare not go to the Governor and say this. He is so rich and has so much wealth of all kinds,' said the man.\", \"'There is no help for it,' said the Master Thief; 'go you must, whether you like it or not. If I can't get you to go by using good words, I will soon make you go with bad ones.'\", \"'Just look at that hare,' said the people in the kitchen, and wanted to go out and catch it.\", \"The Governor saw it too, but said, 'Oh, let it go! it's no use to think of catching a hare when it's running away.'\", 'It was not long before the youth let another hare out, and the people in the kitchen saw this too, and thought that it was the same. So again they wanted to go out and catch it, but the Governor again told them that it was of no use to try.', 'Very soon afterwards, however, the youth let slip the third hare, and it set off and ran round and round the courtyard. The people in the kitchen saw this too, and believed that it was still the same hare that was running about, so they wanted to go out and catch it.', \"'For my part,' said the Priest, 'I can't imagine myself being made a fool of by such a fellow as that!'\", \"'Who is calling me?' said the Priest.\", \"'This is the way to heaven. The way to heaven is not an easy one,' said the Master Thief, and dragged him along till he all but killed him.\", \"'Oh! oh! oh! Where am I now?' asked the Priest.\", \"When the Governor learnt what had happened to the Priest he laughed till he nearly killed himself, but when the Master Thief came and wanted to have his daughter according to promise, he once more gave him nothing but fine words, and said, 'You must give me one more proof of your skill, so that I can really judge of your worth. I have twelve horses in my stable, and I will put twelve stable boys in it, one on each horse. If you are clever enough to steal the horses from under them, I will see what I can do for you.'\", \"'What you set me to do can be done,' said the Master Thief, 'but am I certain to get your daughter when it is?'\", \"'Yes; if you can do that I will do my best for you,' said the Governor.\", \"'What on earth do you want here?' said one of them to the old woman.\", \"'You will get nothing of the kind! Be off this moment! If the Governor were to catch sight of you here, he would lead us a pretty dance,' said one.\", \"'Yes, I am so cold that my teeth are chattering,' said another.\", \"'What is that you have in your flask, old woman?' asked one of the stable boys.\", \"'Do you think you can steal my horse from under me when I am out riding on it?' said he.\", 'When the Master Thief got there the mare went along so slowly and quietly that the cart hardly seemed to move from the spot. The mare pulled it a little forward, and then a little back, and then it stopped quite short. Then the mare pulled a little forward again, and it moved with such difficulty that the Governor had not the least idea that this was the Master Thief. He rode straight up to him, and asked if he had seen anyone hiding anywhere about in a wood that was close by.', \"'No,' said the man, 'that have I not.'\", \"'Oh, just ride off,' said the Governor, 'and I will look after the cask and the horse too.'\", 'So the man said that if he would do that he would go, but he begged the Governor to be very careful to put his finger into the tap-hole the moment he took his out.', 'But time passed, and it grew later and later, and still the man did not come back, and at last the Governor grew so weary of keeping his finger in the tap-hole that he took it out.', 'Well, the Master Thief thought he might if he could hear what it was.', \"'That is by no means impossible,' said the Master Thief. 'I only wish I could get your daughter as easily.'\", \"'Oh no, you must not do that,' said his wife; 'you yourself arranged that he was to come here.'\", \"'Just do what you think best, father,' said his wife.\", 'So the Governor got up and went downstairs, and as soon as he had gone out through the door, the Master Thief stole in and went straight upstairs to the woman.', \"'Well, father dear,' said she, for she thought it was her husband. 'Have you got done already?'\", 'An hour later the real Governor returned.', \"'What do you mean?' asked the Governor.\", 'Towards evening they came to a large forest, and were so tired out with hunger and their long walk, as well as all their trouble, that they crept into a hollow tree and soon fell fast asleep.', 'Next morning, when they woke up, the sun was already high in the heavens and was shining down bright and warm into the tree. Then said brother:', \"'I'm so thirsty, sister; if I did but know where to find a little stream, I'd go and have a drink. I do believe I hear one.' He jumped up, took sister by the hand, and they set off to hunt for the brook.\", 'Now their cruel stepmother was in reality a witch, and she knew perfectly well that the two children had run away. She had crept secretly after them, and had cast her spells over all the streams in the forest.', \"So she cried out, 'Oh! dear brother, pray don't drink, or you'll be turned into a wild beast and tear me to pieces.'\", \"'Very well,' said he, 'I'll wait till we come to the next spring.'\", 'When they came to the second brook, sister heard it repeating too:', \"And she cried, 'Oh! brother, pray don't drink here either, or you'll be turned into a wolf and eat me up.'\", 'Again brother did not drink, but he said:', \"'Well, I'll wait a little longer till we reach the next stream, but then, whatever you may say, I really must drink, for I can bear this thirst no longer.'\", 'And when they got to the third brook, sister heard it say as it rushed past:', \"And she begged, 'Ah! brother, don't drink yet, or you'll become a roe and run away from me.'\", 'Sister cried bitterly over her poor bewitched brother, and the little Roe wept too, and sat sadly by her side. At last the girl said:', \"'Ah!' said he to sister, 'do let me go off to the hunt! I can't keep still any longer.'\", 'And he begged and prayed till at last she consented.', 'So off sprang the little Roe, and he felt quite well and happy in the free open air.', \"'To-morrow we will hunt again,' said the King.\", 'The wound was really so slight that it was quite well next day, and the little Roe did not feel it at all. No sooner did it hear the sounds of hunting in the forest than it cried:', \"'Then I shall die of grief,' replied the Roe, 'for when I hear that horn I feel as if I must jump right out of my skin.'\", \"And when he got to the house he knocked at the door and said, 'My sister dear, open; I'm here.' Then the door opened and the King walked in, and there stood the loveliest maiden he had ever seen.\", \"The girl was much startled when instead of the little Roe she expected she saw a man with a gold crown on his head walk in. But the King looked kindly at her, held out his hand, and said, 'Will you come with me to my castle and be my dear wife?'\", \"'It shall stay with you as long as you live, and shall want for nothing,' the King promised.\", \"'Be quiet, will you,' said the old woman; 'when the time comes I shall be at hand.'\", \"      'Is my child well? Is my Roe well?      I'll come back twice and then farewell.'\", \" The nurse made no answer, but as soon as the Queen had disappeared she went to the King and told him all.

I'll come back once and then farewell.'\", 'That night when the Queen came she said:', \"      'Is my child well? Is my Roe well?      I've come this once, and now farewell.'\", 'When it was over, and they were preparing to go away, the Queen said to them:', 'For that was the name they had given the Princess.', 'But the fairies said they had left their book of magic at home, and they would come another day and tell her.', \"'Ah!' said the Queen, 'I know very well what that means--you have nothing good to say; but at least I beg that you will not hide anything from me.'\", 'Then they went away, leaving the Queen very sad, so sad that the King noticed it, and asked her what was the matter.', \"'Oh I you are not telling me the truth, for I have your ring here in my purse.'\", \"Then it was the King's turn to look sad, and at last he said:\", 'But the Queen cried that she would far rather have her own head cut off, and that he had better think of something else, for she would never consent to such a thing. So they thought and thought, but they could not tell what to do, until at last the Queen heard that in a great forest near the castle there was an old hermit, who lived in a hollow tree, and that people came from far and near to consult him; so she said:', \"'You are welcome, Queen. What do you come to ask of me?'\", 'The new King and his brother said to one another:', \"'Now that we are the masters, let us take our sister out of that dull tower which she is so tired of.'\", \"'Good morning, dear brother. Now that you are King, please take me out of this dull tower, for I am so tired of it.'\", 'At this the King was very much astonished.', \"'But, little sister,' said he, 'where shall we find the King of the Peacocks?'\", \"'Oh! wherever you like, sire,' she answered, 'but I will never marry any one else.'\", 'So they set out, and asked everyone they met--', \"'Do you know the King of the Peacocks?'\", \"But the answer was always, 'No, no.'\", \"'And how do you know that?' said the King.\", 'The King looked at it in silence a long time, but at last he said:', \"'I could not have believed that there was such a beautiful Princess in the world!'\", \"'I think you must be making fun of me,' replied the King of the Peacocks.\", \"'Oh! certainly, we quite agree to that,' said the brothers in one breath.\", \"'Can you take us, can you take us to the kingdom of the peacocks?'\", \"'You must take us, you must take us.'\", \"'Will you take us? will you take us?'\", 'Then she whispered in his ear:', \"'Do you want to make your fortune?'\", \"'I can tell you how to get a bag of gold,' said she.\", \"'Well,' said the nurse, 'to-night, when the Princess is asleep, you must help me to throw her into the sea, and when she is drowned I will put her beautiful clothes upon my daughter, and we will take her to the King of the Peacocks, who will be only too glad to marry her, and as your reward you shall have your boat full of diamonds.'\", \"'That horrid little animal and his mistress are drinking our health in sea-water now.

Good old man, do save me, or I shall die of cold and hunger!'\", 'When they were brought back to the palace some one told the King, who said:', 'ONCE upon a time there lived a King who had three daughters. Now it happened that he had to go out to battle, so he called his daughters and said to them:', 'Now when the girls found themselves alone they felt so sad and dull that they did not know what to do. So, to pass the time, they decided to work for part of the day, to read for part of the day, and to enjoy themselves in the garden for part of the day. As long as they did this all went well with them. But this happy state of things did not last long. Every day they grew more and more curious, and you will see what the end of that was.', 'The three girls entered, and what do you think they saw?', 'Now the Princesses were curious to know what was written in the book, especially the eldest, and this is what she read:', \"'The eldest daughter of this King will marry a prince from the East.'\", 'Then the second girl stepped forward, and turning over the page she read:', \"'The second daughter of this King will marry a prince from the West.'\", \"'The youngest daughter of this King will be married to a pig from the North.'\", 'She almost died of misery, and if her sisters had not held her up, she would have sunk to the ground and cut her head open.', \"'How can you believe such nonsense? When did it ever happen that a king's daughter married a pig?'\", 'Now when the young Princess saw that everything fell out exactly as had been written in the book, she grew very sad. She refused to eat, and would not put on her fine clothes nor go out walking, and declared that she would rather die than become a laughing-stock to the world. But the King would not allow her to do anything so wrong, and he comforted her in all possible ways.', \"'I am glad to see you well, friend,' answered the King, 'but what wind has brought you hither?'\", \"'If you wish me to do this, dear father, I will do it,' replied the girl.\", 'And now she noticed that every night the Pig became a man, and every morning he was changed into a Pig before she awoke. This happened several nights running, and the Princess could not understand it at all. Clearly her husband must be bewitched. In time she grew quite fond of him, he was so kind and gentle.', \"'I shall be grateful to you all my life, old dame,' said the Princess, 'if you will tell me what is the matter with my husband. Why is he a Pig by day and a human being by night?'\", \"'If you will only give it to me,' said the Princess, 'I will give you anything you choose to ask for, for I cannot bear to see him in this state.'\", 'Now who do you think lived there? The Moon.', 'One day the mother of the Moon asked her:', \"'How was it possible for you, a mortal, to get hither to the house of the Moon?'\", \"Then the poor Princess told her all that happened to her, and added 'I shall always be thankful to Heaven for leading me hither, and grateful to you that you took pity on me and on my baby, and did not leave us to die.

'I should so like to go and amuse myself with the other children.'\", 'Minnikin promised this, and ran down to the sea-shore.', \"'Can you fight?' roared the Troll.\", \"'If not, I can learn,' said Minnikin.\", \"'Come and sleep a bit with your head in my lap,' she said to Minnikin, and as he slept she put a golden dress on him.\", 'So when the kitchen-maid heard that they were for her, she asked no more questions about the matter.

You are going to have one daughter of mine, but if you can set free the other, who has been taken by the Troll, you shall willingly have her too, and the other half of the kingdom as well.'\", 'So the King said he should have these things, but the King was afraid that he had no ship large enough to carry them all.', 'When they had sailed thus a long, long way, the ship stopped short in the middle of the sea.', \"'Ah, now we have got there,' said Minnikin, 'but how we are to get back again is a very different thing.'\", \"'Ah, heaven be praised!' she cried, 'I have not seen a Christian man since I came here.'\", \"'I have come for you,' said Minnikin.\", \"'You had better tell me about him,' said Minnikin. 'Where is he gone? It would be amusing to see him.'\", \"'I can do that,' said Minnikin.\", 'Minnikin did this, and almost before he had crept into the cupboard and hidden himself, came the Troll.', \"'Yes, it must be that,' said the Troll.\", \"'No, there is no one who can do it,' said the Troll.\", \"'A short time since there was a man here who said he could do it,' said the King's daughter.\", \"'How clever you always are!' said the Troll. 'How could you let him go away? You must have known that I was just wanting a man of that kind.'\", \"'Let him come in,' said the Troll.\", \"'Now, as you know,' said Minnikin, 'we are so like each other that no one can tell one of us from the other; so just change clothes with me and go up to the palace, and then the Princesses will think that I am coming in, and the one who kisses you first shall be yours, and I will have the other.'

'Well, if you must know, my heart is in the bed-cover.'\", \"'Now where is it, dear husband?'\", \"'It is in the doorway,' he replied.\", \"'I did it to show my love for your heart,' said the girl.\", \"And again the old man smiled, saying, 'You are a dear child, but my heart is not in the doorway.'\", \"Then the poor young bride was very vexed, and said, 'Ah, my dear! you really have a heart somewhere, so you may die and leave me all alone.'\", \"It made the little bride quite sad to think she could do nothing to show her love for the old man's heart. She used to think about it as she sat all alone during the long days, for her husband was almost always out.\", \"One day a young traveller came past the house, and seeing such a pretty girl he wished her 'Good day.'\", 'She returned his greeting, and as he drew near she asked him whence he came and where he was going.', \"'Oh, good friend,' said the girl, 'you need go no farther. Come, sit down, eat and drink, and afterwards I'll tell you all about it.'\", \"She gave him food, and when he had finished his meal she told him how his brothers had come to the town where she lived with her sisters, how they had each chosen a bride, and, taking herself with them, had started for home. She wept as she told how the others were turned to stone, and how she was kept as the old man's bride. She left out nothing, even telling him the story of her husband's heart.\", \"When the young man heard this he said: 'I shall go in search of the bird. It may be that God will help me to find and catch it.'\", \"'Yes, do go,' she said; 'it will be a good deed, for then you can set your brothers and my sisters free.' Then she hid the young man, for it was now late, and her husband would soon be home.\", \"He walked on and on till he thought it must be time for breakfast; so he opened his knapsack, and was delighted to find such a store of good things. 'What a feast!' he exclaimed; 'will anyone come and share it?'\", \"'By all means. Help yourself to what I have,' said the young traveller. And the two enjoyed their meal together.\", \"'Why not?' said the youth. 'Come down and take all you want. There won't be much left after this.'\", \"'What a hurry he was in!' the youth said to himself. 'He might have been able to direct me to the church, for I shall never find it alone.'\", 'He gathered up his things, and started to walk a little farther before resting. He had not gone far when all of a sudden he saw the church!', 'It was too late to attempt anything now; and, besides, the poor youth was very tired, so he lay down on the ground and fell fast asleep.', 'The young man quickly entered the church, and saw a bird flying about, but he could not catch it.', 'The young man hurried home as fast as possible, and reached the cottage before evening. He told his story to the little bride, who, after giving him some food and drink, hid him with his bird beneath the bed.', 'After that they all went away and were married, and lived many years happily together.', \"'Oh, do not kill me yet!' begged the fish; 'I will bring you good luck--indeed I will!'\", 'But his brother was sorry for the fish, and put in a word for him.', \"'Let the poor little fellow live. He would hardly make one bite, and, after all, how do we know we are not throwing away our luck! Put him back into the sea. It will be much better.'\", \"'Oh dear, what nonsense!' exclaimed the elder; 'and, besides, what proof have we that you are speaking the truth?'\", \"'There!' said the younger brother. 'Are you not thankful you did not eat that fish? He has brought us good luck, and there is no knowing how great we may become! Now, we will each seek our own adventures. If you will take one road I will go the other.'\", \"'Very well,' replied the elder; 'but how shall we let each other know if we are both living?'\", \"When the young man saw the maiden weeping bitterly he said to her, 'What is the matter, my poor girl?'\", \"'I shall stay,' replied the young man, 'for I mean to set you free.'\", \"'That is impossible. You do not know what a fearful monster the serpent is; you can do nothing against him.'\", \"But he answered, 'I cannot become your husband yet, for I have still far to travel. But wait for me seven years and seven months. Then, if I do not return, you are free to marry whom you will. And in case you should have forgotten, I will take these seven tongues with me so that when I bring them forth you may know that I am really he who slew the serpent.'\", 'What could the poor girl do? This time there was no knight to come to her aid. So she promised to do as the slave wished, and he took up the seven heads and brought the princess to her father.', 'And the slave was called upon to tell how he had slain the monster, and when he had ended the king declared that he should have the princess to wife.', \"All this time the young man was riding through the world, and when the seven years and seven months were over he came back to the town where the princess lived--only a few days before the wedding. And he stood before the king, and said to him: 'Give me your daughter, O king, for I slew the seven-headed serpent. And as a sign that my words are true, look on these seven tongues, which I cut from his seven heads, and on this embroidered cloth, which was given me by your daughter.'\", 'So the false slave was put to death, that none might follow in his footsteps, and the wedding feast was held, and the hearts of all rejoiced that the true bridegroom had come at last.', \"'What can it be?' he said to his wife.\", \" 'Ah! do not look at it,' she answered, 'for it comes from the house of a wicked witch whom no man can manage to kill.' But the princess had better have kept silence, for her words made her husband's heart burn within him, and he longed to try his strength against the witch's cunning. And all day long the feeling grew stronger, till the next morning he mounted his horse, and in spite of his wife's tears, he rode off to the mountain.\", \"'Oh, what nonsense!' cried he. 'Be quiet, old woman. What could you do with one hair?' But the witch pulled out a hair and laid it on his shoulder, and his limbs grew cold and heavy, and he could not stir.\", 'In this manner several days went by. And one evening, as the young man leaned from the balcony, he saw a bright light shining on the mountain.', \"'What can that be?' he said to the princess.\", \"'Can you, indeed?' said the young man, seizing her by the hair. 'You old wretch! tell me what you have done with my brother, or I will cut your head off this very instant.' Now the witch's strength was all gone from her, and she had to obey.\", \"'I will take you to your brother,' she said, hoping to get the better of him by cunning, 'but leave me alone. You hold me so tight that I cannot walk.'\", \"'That is my brother,' said he. 'Now give me the ointment that will restore him to life.'\", \"'The old witch had enchanted you, but now she is dead and you are free. We will wake up the other knights that she laid under her spells, and then we will go.'\", \"They had much to tell each other as they rode along, and at last the younger man exclaimed, 'O fool, to leave such a beautiful wife to go and fight a witch! She took me for her husband, and I did not say her nay.'\", \"When the elder brother heard this a great rage filled his heart, and, without saying one word, he drew his sword and slew his brother, and his body rolled in the dust. Then he rode on till he reached his home, where his wife was still sitting, weeping bitterly. When she saw him she sprang up with a cry, and threw herself into his arms. 'Oh, how long have I waited for thee! Never, never must you leave me any more!'\", \"When the old king heard the news he welcomed him as a son, and made ready a feast, and all the court sat down. And in the evening, when the young man was alone with his wife, she said to him, 'Why would you not let me touch you when you came back, but always thrust me away when I tried to put my arms round you or kiss you?'\", \"'I am going about seeking for service,' said the boy.\", \"'Will you serve me?' asked the man.\", \"'Oh, yes; just as readily you as anyone else,' said the boy.\", \"'But can you read?' asked the man.\", \"'As well as the priest,' said the boy.\", \"Then I can't have you,' said the man. 'In fact, I was just wanting a boy who couldn't read. His only work would be to dust my old books.'\", 'The man then went on his way, and left the boy looking after him.', \"'It was a pity I didn't get that place,' thought he 'That was just the very thing for me.'\", \"'Where are you going, my little boy?' said the man, who did not notice that it was the same one he had met before.\", \"'I am going about seeking for service?' said the boy.\", \"'Will you serve me?' asked the man.\", \"'Oh, yes; just as readily you as anyone else,' said the boy.\", \"'But can you read?' said the man.\", \"'No, I don't know a single letter,' said the boy.\", 'When he had learned all this he did not think it worth while staying there any longer, so he ran away home to his parents again. Soon after this there was a market in the next village, and the boy told his mother that he had learned how to change himself into the shape of any animal he chose.', \"'Now,' said he, 'I shall change myself to a horse, and father can take me to market and sell me. I shall come home again all right.'\", 'His mother was frightened at the idea, but the boy told her that she need not be alarmed; all would be well. So he changed himself to a horse, such a fine horse, too, that his father got a high price for it at the market; but after the bargain was made, and the money paid, the boy changed again to his own shape, when no one was looking, and went home.', 'The story spread all over the country about the fine horse that had been sold and then had disappeared, and at last the news came to the ears of the wizard.', 'The wizard was now dead, the pole-cat put on human shape, and the youth afterwards married the girl, and from that time forward let all his magic arts alone.', \"So the father ordered a beautiful ship to be fitted up, and the young man sailed away in it. After some weeks the vessel cast anchor before a large town, and the merchant's son went on shore.\", 'So saying, he commanded the doors to be thrown open, and food and drink to be set before the young man, who, after he had eaten, began to look for the princess. But though he visited every corner and chest and cupboard, she was not in any of them, and after eight days he gave it up and his head was cut off.', \"All this time his father and brothers had had no news of him, and were very anxious. At last the second son could bear it no longer, and said, 'Dear father, give me, I pray you, a large ship and some money, and let me go and seek for my brother.'\", \"Now when he saw the first ship lying at anchor his heart beat high, and he said to himself, 'My brother cannot surely be far off,' and he ordered a boat and was put on shore.\", 'On the way he met an old woman, who stopped and begged.', \"'I tell you, old woman, leave me alone.'\", \"'You are in some trouble?' she asked. 'Tell me what it is, and perhaps I can help you.'\", \"Then he told her how he had set his heart on finding the king's daughter.\", \"'I can easily manage that for you as long as you have enough money.'\", \"'Oh, as to that, I have plenty,' answered he.\", \"The young man did as he was bid, and when the lion was made the old woman hid the youth in it, and brought it to the king, who was so delighted with it that he wanted to buy it. But she replied, 'It does not belong to me, and my master will not part from it at any price.'\", \"'Yes, I can do that,' answered the old woman; 'but to-morrow I must have it back again. And she went away.\", 'The king did not stay long, and when he left he handed over the lion to the maidens, who amused themselves with it for some time, till they got sleepy, and thought it was time to go to bed. But the princess took the lion into her own room and laid it on the floor.', \"'What use is that?' she asked. 'For if you cannot pick me out from among my companions you will still lose your head.'\", \"'I look to you to help me,' he said. 'I have done so much for you that you might do this one thing for me.'\", 'The next morning the king came very early to fetch the lion, as the old woman was already at the palace asking for it.

I will tell her of your prayer.'\", 'So the Moon came out, and when she saw the maiden she knew her again, for she had watched her sleeping both in the cottage and in the palace.

'I will tell him of your prayer.'\", 'And the Wind looked on her and knew her again, for he had seen her in the cottage and in the palace, and he spake to her and said:', \"'Do you, rich as you are, want help?'\", \"'Don't be frightened; I will go and see if I can find out something.'\", 'Who can tell the despair which seized the poor maiden when she heard this news! As soon as she could speak she implored the Wind to do all he could to get the wedding put off for two or three days, for it would take her all that time to reach the palace of the king.', \"'Is not the princess to be married to-day?'\", 'The maiden fixed a large sum, many pieces of gold, but the princess had set her heart on the mantle, and gave it readily.', 'This time the maiden answered that the price of the dress was the permission to see the bridegroom.', \"'We can't do that,' shouted the princes; 'he doesn't belong to us so we can't give him away.'\", \"'Oh yes, indeed,' said the old woman; 'what is it that you want?'\", \"'I want the princess here who is in the shape of a white dove,' said the prince.\", \"'What will you do with it?' asked the witch.\", \"'Yes, I will,' said the prince, for he saw the red silk thread on the old woman's finger.\", 'Then their marriage had to be celebrated, for the witch had to stick to what she had promised, and he must get the princess whatever might happen afterwards.', \"With the first sunbeam the princess said to the prince, 'Look round; do you see anything behind us?'\", \"'Yes, I see a dark cloud, far away,' said he.\", \"'Then throw the flower-pot over your head,' said she. When this was done there was a large thick forest behind them.\", 'When the witch came to the forest she could not get through it until she went home and brought her axe to cut a path.', \"A little after this the princess said again to the prince, 'Look round; do you see anything behind us?'\", \"'Yes,' said the prince, 'the big black cloud is there again.'\", \"'Then throw the glass of water over your head,' said she.\", \" There was once a lad who went to look for a place.

You need not be afraid of taking service with me, for there is no danger in it if you only know how to obey.'\", 'The bargain was made, and the lad went home with the man to whom he had engaged himself. It was a strange place indeed, for he lived in a bank in the middle of the wild forest, and the lad saw there no other person than his master.

Do you hear what the little hare is saying?'\", 'So Big Lion sent for the little hare, and asked him what he meant by talking like that.', \"'Oh, my good rabbit, never mind that! I've got such a wonderful secret to tell you! Do you know what to do so as to escape death?'\", \"So they dug a hole, and then the little hare said, 'The next thing is to make a fire in the hole,' and they set to work to collect wood, and lit quite a large fire.\", 'And the rabbit came in a great hurry and pulled him out.', 'When the fire was quite out the little hare went and picked up one of these bones, and made a flute out of it, and sang this song:', \"'What is it?' asked Big Lion.\", \"'We must dig a ditch, and then you must lie in it and pretend to be dead.'\", \"But her father answered, 'Oh, my dear child, you don't know what you are talking about.'\", \"She replied, 'Yes, father, it is quite true. I saw it with my own eyes.'\", \"The father did not know what to think, and told one of his friends, who said, 'To-morrow we had better keep watch ourselves.'\", \"'No, I have seen no one.'\", 'The old man seized her hands eagerly, but no time was given him to ask any questions, for the maiden drew him into the house, and set food before him, and waited on him herself.', \"'No, no!' exclaimed his sons; 'that you shall never do. Rather, if it must be, would we do it ourselves. But we have thought of a better plan than that.'\", \"'What is it?' asked the father.\", 'One very hot evening, after they had been working hard all day, they fell asleep under a tree in front of the hut. And as they slept there came by three fairies, who stopped to look at them.', \"'What fine fellows!' said one. 'Let us give them a present.'\", \"'Yes, what shall it be?' asked another.\", \"'O Ciccu! stay with us,' they cried. 'We are very happy here; and who knows how we shall get on elsewhere?'\", \"'We can always try,' answered Ciccu; 'and if times are bad we can come back here and take up wood-cutting.' So saying he picked up his bundle of sticks, and his brothers did the same.\", \"'How did you manage?' they asked.\", \"'Never you mind,' answered he. 'I have paid every penny,' and no more would he say. But the other two were very uneasy, for they felt sure something must be wrong, and the sooner they parted company with Ciccu the better. Ciccu understood what they were thinking, and, drawing forty gold pieces from his pocket, he held out twenty to each, saying, 'Take these and turn them to good account. I am going away to seek my own fortune.' Then he embraced them, and struck down another road.\", 'He wandered on for many days, till at length he came to the town where the king had his court. The first thing Ciccu did was to order himself some fine clothes, and then buy a grand house, just opposite the palace.', \"On the road he met a little old man who stopped and said to him, 'What have you got there, my fine fellow?'\", \"'How can I get it?' asked the king.\", \"'Oh, Ciccu can get it for you; ask him.'\", \"'Oh, delighted!' said the Man-eater, and laid himself at full length in the coffin. Ciccu clapped on the lid, put a strong cord round it, tied it fast on his horse, and rode back to the king. And when the king saw that he really had brought back the Man-eater, he commanded a huge iron chest to be brought, and locked the coffin up inside.\", \"Just about this time the queen died, and soon after the king thought he should like to marry again. He sought everywhere, but he could not hear of any princess that took his fancy. Then the two envious brothers came to him and said, 'O king! there is but one woman that is worthy of being your wife, and that is she who is the fairest in the whole world.'\", \"'But where can I find her?' asked the king\", \"'Oh, Ciccu will know, and he will bring her to you.'\", \"But she answered, 'That can only be when Ciccu brings me the veil that I let fall on my way here.'\", \"'It will be all right,' answered the horse when he had heard his tale; 'just take enough food for the day for both of us, and then get on my back.'\", \"Now the king was enchanted to see him so soon, and took the veil from Ciccu and flung it over the princess, crying, 'Here is the veil you asked for, so I claim you for my wife.'\", 'Ciccu did as the horse told him, and a voice was heard in answer that seemed to come from a very long way off.', \"'What is your will?' it asked; and Ciccu replied that he had been commanded to bring back the ring that the princess had flung away, as she rode past.\", 'And sure enough, very soon a little fish was seen rising to the surface with the lost ring in his mouth. And Ciccu knew him to be the fish that he had saved from death, and he took the ring and rode back with it to the king.', \"This time Ciccu felt that no escape was possible, and he went to the horse and laid his hand on his neck. 'Now it is indeed good-bye, and there is no help to be got even from you,' and he told him what fate awaited him.\", \"And when the fairest in the world saw what he had done, love entered into her heart, and she said to the king, 'One thing more: before I can be your wife, you must jump into the oven as Ciccu has done.'\", \"Then the fairest in the world held out her hand to Ciccu and smiled, saying, 'Now we will be man and wife.' So Ciccu married the fairest in the world, and became king of the country.\", \"'What is that you can do?' laughed the gentleman.\", \"'No, father; you may cut off my head, if you choose, but marry that horrible beggar--I never will!'\", \"'It went off very well,' answered the Cat.\", \"'What was the child's name?' asked the Mouse.\", \"Not long after this another great longing came over the Cat. She said to the Mouse, 'You must again be kind enough to look after the house alone, for I have been asked a second time to stand godmother, and as this child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.'\", \"'It won't please you any better,' said the Cat, 'he was called Clean Gone.'\", \"'Yes, indeed,' answered the Cat; 'it will taste as good to you as if you stretched your thin tongue out of the window.'\", 'They started off, and when they reached it they found the pot in its place, but quite empty!', \"'Ah,' said the Mouse,' 'now I know what has happened! It has all come out! You are a true friend to me! You have eaten it all when you stood godmother; first the top off, then half of it gone, then----'\", 'You see that is the way of the world.', \"'Good woman,' he said to her, 'can you not show me the way out of the wood?'\", \"'Oh, certainly, Sir King,' she replied, 'I can quite well do that, but on one condition, which if you do not fulfil you will never get out of the wood, and will die of hunger.'\", \"'What is the condition?' asked the King.\", \"'I have a daughter,' said the old woman, 'who is so beautiful that she has not her equal in the world, and is well fitted to be your wife; if you will make her lady-queen I will show you the way out of the wood.'\", 'The next day the King came to visit his children, but he found no one but the girl.', \"'Where are your brothers?' asked the King.\", \"Then the little sister cried and said, 'Can you not be freed?'\", \"'Come down to us,' they said, 'we will do you no harm.'\", 'But the King and the Queen with their six brothers lived many years in happiness and peace.', \" 'But where is he to find the Witch-maiden?' said the first bird. 'She has no settled dwelling, but is here to-day and gone to-morrow. He might as well try to catch the wind.'\", \"'Well,' said the first bird, 'the spring is not far from here. Shall we go and see how it is she does it?'\", \"'The sun is not down yet,' said the first bird; 'we must wait yet awhile till the moon rises and the maiden comes to the spring. Do you think she will see that young man sitting under the tree?'\", \"'We will wait,' said the first bird, 'and see how they get on together.'\", \"The maiden answered kindly, 'Come and spend this night with us. You will sleep better on a pillow than on damp moss.'\", \"The next morning the maiden asked him whether he would not like to stay with her always in this beautiful place, and as he did not answer immediately, she continued: 'You see how I always remain young and beautiful, and I am under no one's orders, but can do just what I like, so that I have never thought of marrying before. But from the moment I saw you I took a fancy to you, so if you agree, we might be married and might live together like princes, because I have great riches.'\", \"When the youth heard all this he determined to try and get possession of the ring, though he did not quite believe in all its wonderful gifts. He wished the maiden would let him have it in his hand, but he did not quite like to ask her to do so, and after a while she put it back into the box. A few days after they were again speaking of the magic ring, and the youth said, 'I do not think it possible that the ring can have all the power you say it has.'\", \"'Oh, the middle finger of your left hand,' the maiden answered, laughing.\", \"'Now,' said the maiden, 'you are invisible to me until you take the ring off again.'\", \"When the maiden saw him flying away she thought at first that he was still in play, and cried, 'Come back, friend, for now you see I have told you the truth.'

But he remembered when he thought about it that whoever was stupid or not fit for his office would not be able to see it. Now he certainly believed that he had nothing to fear for himself, but he wanted first to send somebody else in order to see how he stood with regard to his office. Everybody in the whole town knew what a wonderful power the cloth had, and they were all curious to see how bad or how stupid their neighbour was.\", \"'Dear, dear!' thought he, 'can I be stupid? I have never thought that, and nobody must know it! Can I be not fit for my office? No, I must certainly not say that I cannot see the cloth!'\", 'The old minister paid great attention, so that he could tell the same to the Emperor when he came back to him, which he did.', 'Everybody in the town was talking of the magnificent cloth.', \"'Yes,' said all the knights, but they could see nothing, for there was nothing there.\", \"'But he has nothing on!' said a little child at last.\", \"'Just listen to the innocent child!' said the father, and each one whispered to his neighbour what the child had said.\", \"'But he has nothing on!' the whole of the people called out at last.\", 'She turned round in surprise, and then she saw the little creature, the Golden Crab.', \"Then the Crab gave her a golden rod, and said, 'Go and strike with this rod three times upon the ground on the place which the King showed you, and to-morrow morning the wall will be there.'\", 'The old woman did so and went away again.', 'So the old woman had to strike again three times upon the ground with the rod, and the next morning the garden was there.

No sooner had he finished than the Princess asked him whether he could find the way to that palace.', 'And now she desired him to guide her thither at once. The old man did so, and when they came to the palace he hid her behind the great picture and advised her to keep quite still, and he placed himself behind the picture also.

He was turning aside to avoid it, when he heard the sound of someone crying in the ditch. He dismounted from his horse, and stepped along in the direction the sound came from. To his astonishment he found an old woman, who begged him to help her out of the ditch. The Prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave, asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there.', \"'My son,' answered the old woman, 'I am a very poor woman, and soon after midnight I set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning; but I lost my way in the dark, and fell into this deep ditch, where I might have remained for ever but for your kindness.'\", \"Then the Prince said to her, 'You can hardly walk; I will put you on my horse and lead you home. Where do you live?'\", 'Then it dawned on the Prince that he had been speaking to a good fairy, and putting the little bell carefully in his pocket, he rode home and told his father that he meant to set the daughter of the Flower Queen free, and intended setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid.', \"'No, I do not,' answered the old man. 'But if you go straight along this road for a year, you will reach a hut where my father lives, and possibly he may be able to tell you.'\", \"The Prince thanked him for his information, and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road, and at the end of it came to the little hut, where he found a very old man. He asked him the same question, and the old man answered, 'No, I do not know where the Dragon lives. But go straight along this road for another year, and you will come to a hut in which my father lives. I know he can tell you.'\", \"The Prince replied, 'I have heard so much of the beauty and kindness of the Dragon's Mother, and would like to enter her service.'\", \"The Prince answered at once, 'I have heard so much of your beauty and kindness, that I would very much like to enter your service.'\", \"'Very well,' said the Mother Dragon; 'but if you wish to enter my service, you must first lead my mare out to the meadow and look after her for three days; but if you don't bring her home safely every evening, we will eat you up.'\", \"Then the beautiful girl said to him, 'If you succeed in bringing the mare back safely the third day, ask the Mother Dragon to give you a foal of the mare as a reward.'\", \"The ball came to an end at midnight, and early next morning the Prince again led the Mother Dragon's mare out into the meadow.

After the ball we will fly away together.'\", 'On the third day the Prince led the mare to the meadow again; but once more she vanished before his eyes. Then the Prince took out his little bell and rang it three times.', 'Towards evening the mare was returned to him, and when he led her home to the Mother Dragon she said to him:', \"'You are a brave youth, and I will make you my body-servant. But what shall I give you as a reward to begin with?'\", 'The Prince begged for a foal of the mare, which the Mother Dragon at once gave him, and over and above, a cloak made of gold, for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty.', \"But the foolish youth kept repeating, 'I will go, I will go, I will go!'\", \"'I am off to the King's Court,' he answered.

I knew they were after somebody, but I couldn't see who it was. They won't touch you so long as I'm with you.'\", \"'I don't know him.' 'I'm his son, though.'\", \"'And why should the goblins mind you, pray?'\", \"'What do they do to him?' asked Irene, with a trembling voice.\", \"'Yes, indeed it is!' said the nurse, beginning to cry again.  'And I shall have to suffer for it.'\", \"'Don't go on like that,' said the nurse to the boy, almost fiercely. 'How could I help it?  I lost my way.'\", 'They soon had her between them, holding a hand of each.', \"'I don't want to run,' said Irene.\", \"'You don't think of me,' said the nurse.\", \"'Yes, I do, Lootie.  The boy says they won't touch us if we don't run.'\", \"'Yes, but if they know at the house that I've kept you out so late I shall be turned away, and that would break my heart.'\", \"'But I'll tell him it was all my fault.  And you know it was, Lootie.'\", \"'He won't mind that.  I'm sure he won't.'\", \"'Then I'll cry, and go down on my knees to him, and beg him not to take away my own dear Lootie.'\", 'The nurse was comforted at hearing this, and said no more.  They went on, walking pretty fast, but taking care not to run a step.', \"'I don't know what more.  What more is my name, Lootie?'\", \"'Oh, then, Curdie, you must call me just Irene and no more.'\", \"'What shall he call me, then, Lootie?'\", \"'I'm not going out of my way yet,' said Curdie.  'It's on the other side of those rocks the path turns off to my father's.'\", \"'You dear, good, kind Curdie!  I'll give you a kiss when we get home,' said the princess.\", \"'Do you know, Curdie, I don't quite like your song: it sounds to me rather rude,' she said.\", \"'Well, perhaps it is,' answered Curdie.  'I never thought of that; it's a way we have.  We do it because they don't like it.'\", \"'I beg you won't.  Please don't.'\", \"'Oh! if you ask me that way, of course, I won't; though I don't a bit know why.  Look! there are the lights of your great house down below. You'll be at home in five minutes now.'\", \"'But I promised,' said the princess.\", \"'Oh, thank you, Curdie!' said the princess, and stopped crying.\", \"'Good night, Irene; good night, Lootie,' said Curdie, and turned and was out of sight in a moment.\", \"'You will see him,' said Irene.  'You may be sure Curdie will keep his word.  He's sure to come again.'\", \"'I'm sorry for that, father,' said Curdie.\", \"'Oh, it's not much.  You'll be sure to take care of yourself, won't you?'\", \"'Yes, father; I will.  I'll keep a sharp look-out, I promise you.' Curdie was the only one who remained in the mine.  About six o'clock the rest went away, everyone bidding him good night, and telling him to take care of himself; for he was a great favourite with them all.\", \"'I'll do my best,' said Curdie.  'I'm not afraid.' 'We all know that,' they returned, and left him.\", \"'You say so, dad.  I think myself I'm all right.  But I could carry ten times as much if it wasn't for my feet.'\", \"'But why don't we wear shoes like them, father?  I should like it--especially when I've got a chest like that on my head.'\", \"'I'm sure I wouldn't wear them--no, not for--that I wouldn't!' said the first voice, which was evidently that of the mother of the family.  'I can't think why either of them should.'\", \"'What made her die, then?  Didn't the air agree with her?'\", \"'She died when the young prince was born.'\", \"'How silly of her!  We never do that.  It must have been because she wore shoes.'\", \"'Why do they wear shoes up there?'\", \"'No!  Did you?  How was it?'\", \"'Never you mind how it was.  She didn't know I saw them.  And what do you think!--they had toes!'\", \"'You may well ask!  I should never have known if I had not seen the queen's feet.  Just imagine! the ends of her feet were split up into five or six thin pieces!'\", \"'Oh, horrid!  How could the king have fallen in love with her?'\", \"'You forget that she wore shoes.  That is just why she wore them. That is why all the men, and women too, upstairs wear shoes.  They can't bear the sight of their own feet without them.'\", \"'But with such a big box on my head--'\", \"'Well, I never knew so much before!' remarked a fourth voice.\", \"'What are you laughing at, husband?'\", \"'Oh, yes, you do mean something.  You always do mean something.'\", \"'It's more than you do, then, wife.' 'That may be; but it's not more than I find out, you know.'\", \"'But what shall we do when you are at the palace?' she asked.\", 'Laying hold of a large one with both his hands, he drew it gently out, and let it down softly.', \"'What was that noise?' said the goblin father.\", 'Curdie blew out his light, lest it should shine through.', \"'No; he's been gone a good while.  I haven't heard a blow for an hour. Besides, it wasn't like that.'\", \"'Then I suppose it must have been a stone carried down the brook inside.'\", \"'But it was, father.  I felt it.'\", \"'But I did feel it, father.'\", \"'I wish it was my chest, father.'\", ' The Hall of the Goblin Palace', \"'Not quite so much,' thought Curdie to himself.\", \"'Now, my child, what shall we do next?'\", \"'I should like you to take me to see my great old grandmother.'\", 'The king looked grave And said:', \"'What does my little daughter mean?'\", \"'I mean the Queen Irene that lives up in the tower--the very old lady, you know, with the long hair of silver.'\", 'The king only gazed at his little princess with a look which she could not understand.', \"'No,' said the king, very quietly.\", \"'Then it must all be a dream,' said Irene.  'I half thought it was; but I couldn't be sure.  Now I am sure of it.  Besides, I couldn't find her the next time I went up.'\", \"'Come, my child; we'll have a walk in the garden together,' he said.\", \"'You won't come up and see my huge, great, beautiful grandmother, then, king-papa?' said the princess.\", \"'Not this time,' said the king very gently.  'She has not invited me, you know, and great old ladies like her do not choose to be visited without leave asked and given.'\", \"'You were out late one evening, Irene.'\", \"'Yes, papa.  It was my fault; and Lootie was very sorry.'\", \"'I must talk to Lootie about it,' said the king.\", \"I can't tell you how he had come to know.  I am sure Curdie had not told him.  Someone about the palace must have seen them, after all.\", 'When in the evening he rode away upon his great white horse, he left six of his attendants behind him, with orders that three of them should watch outside the house every night, walking round and round it from sunset to sunrise.  It was clear he was not quite comfortable about the princess.', \"'But you told me to tell Lootie.'\", \"'Yes.  But I knew Lootie would not believe you.  If she were to see me sitting spinning here, she wouldn't believe me, either.'\", \"'Just like me,' said Irene, feeling very much ashamed of herself.\", \"'Yes, a good deal like you, but not just like you; for you've come again; and Lootie wouldn't have come again.  She would have said, No, no--she had had enough of such nonsense.'\", \"'Is it naughty of Lootie, then?'\", \"'It would be naughty of you.  I've never done anything for Lootie.'\", \"'And you did wash my face and hands for me,' said Irene, beginning to cry.\", 'The old lady smiled a sweet smile and said:', \"'I'm not vexed with you, my child--nor with Lootie either.  But I don't want you to say anything more to Lootie about me.  If she should ask you, you must just be silent.  But I do not think she will ask you.'\", 'All the time they talked the old lady kept on spinning.', \"'You haven't told me yet what I am spinning,' she said.\", \"'For me!  What am I to do with it, please?'\", \"Then she took Irene by the hand, but it was her bad hand and Irene gave a little cry of pain.  'My child!' said her grandmother, 'what is the matter?'\", \"'You won't be afraid, then, to go to bed with such an old woman?'\", \"'No.  You are so beautiful, grandmother.'\", \"'And I suppose I am very young.  You won't mind sleeping with such a very young woman, grandmother?'\", \"'Why don't you put out your moon?' asked the princess.\", \"'But if somebody besides the pigeons were to see it--somebody about the house, I mean--they would come to look what it was and find you.'\", \"'The better for them, then,' said the old lady.  'But it does not happen above five times in a hundred years that anyone does see it.\", \"'I hope it will never go out,' said the princess.\", \"'I hope not.  But it is time we both went to sleep.  Shall I take you in my arms?'\", \"'Oh, dear! this is so nice!' said the princess.  'I didn't know anything in the world could be so comfortable.  I should like to lie here for ever.'\", \"'You may if you will,' said the old lady.  'But I must put you to one trial-not a very hard one, I hope.  This night week you must come back to me.  If you don't, I do not know when you may find me again, and you will soon want me very much.'\", \"'Oh! please, don't let me forget.'\", \"'You shall not forget.  The only question is whether you will believe I am anywhere--whether you will believe I am anything but a dream.  You may be sure I will do all I can to help you to come. But it will rest with yourself, after all.  On the night of next Friday, you must come to me.  Mind now.'\", \"'I will try,' said the princess.\", \"'Then good night,' said the old lady, and kissed the forehead which lay in her bosom.\", \"'I can't think how you do it, mother,' he would say.\", \"'Why, what's the matter?' asked her grandmother.  'You haven't been doing anything wrong--I know that by your face, though it is rather miserable.  What's the matter, my dear?'\", 'And she still held out her arms.', 'And still she held out her arms.', \"'There!' said her grandmother, 'you won't mind coming to me now?'\", \"'Go and look into it,' said the lady.\", 'Irene went, and came back very silent with her eyes shining.', \"'What did you see?' asked her grandmother.\", \"'The sky, and the moon and the stars,' she answered.  'It looked as if there was no bottom to it.'\", 'The lady smiled a pleased satisfied smile, and was silent also for a few moments.  Then she said:', \"'Yes, my child--it was my lamp.'\", \"'Then how was it?  I don't see a window all round.'\", \"'How is it that I can, then?  I'm sure I don't know.'\", \"'It is a gift born with you.  And one day I hope everybody will have it.'\", \"'But how do you make it shine through the walls?'\", \"'There, Irene; there is my work for you!' she said, holding out the ball to the princess.\", \"'Is this all your spinning, grandmother?' she asked.\", \"'All since you came to the house.  There is more there than you think.'\", \"'How pretty it is!  What am I to do with it, please?'\", \"'Give me your hand,' she said.  Irene held up her right hand.\", \"'What a beautiful ring!' said Irene.  'What is the stone called?'\", \"'Yes, it is my crown.  The stone in your ring is of the same sort--only not so good.  It has only red, but mine have all colours, you see.'\", \"'You will ask her where you got it,' answered the lady smiling.\", \"'I don't see how I can do that.'\", \"'Of course I will, if you say so.  But, you know, I can't pretend not to know.'\", \"'Of course not.  But don't trouble yourself about it.  You will see when the time comes.'\", 'So saying, the lady turned, and threw the little ball into the rose fire.', \"'Oh, grandmother!' exclaimed Irene; 'I thought you had spun it for me.'\", \"'So I did, my child.  And you've got it.'\", \"'No; it's burnt in the fire!'\", \"'Oh! I'm not to take it with me!  You are going to keep it for me!'\", \"'You are to take it with you.  I've fastened the end of it to the ring on your finger.'\", \"'I can't see it there, grandmother,' she said.\", \"'No.  The thread is too fine for you to see it.  You can only feel it. Now you can fancy how much spinning that took, although it does seem such a little ball.'\", \"'Oh, how delightful!  It will lead me to you, grandmother, I know!'\", \"'Oh, grandmother! here have I been sitting all this time in your chair, and you standing!  I beg your pardon.'\", 'The lady laid her hand on her shoulder, and said:', \"'How kind of you!' said the princess, and sat down again.\", \"'It makes me happy,' said the lady.\", \"'You may, my child.  And I trust you will always think it your home. Now come.  I must take you back without anyone seeing you.'\", \"'No, child,' answered her grandmother; 'it is because I felt so young this evening that I put my crown on.  And I thought you would like to see your old grandmother in her best.'\", \"'Why do you call yourself old?  You're not old, grandmother.'\", \"'Not for long, at least, my child.  Perhaps by the time I am two thousand years of age, I shall, indeed, never be afraid of anything. But I confess I have sometimes been afraid about my children--sometimes about you, Irene.'\", \"'Not if you had time to think about it.  But when those creatures came at you that night on the mountain, you were so frightened yourself that you lost your way home.'\", \"'I think it must have been your mother gave it you, princess; but really, for as long as you have worn it, I don't remember that ever I heard,' answered her nurse.\", \"'I will ask my king-papa the next time he comes,' said Irene.\", 'After they had been alone for a little while, she thought of what she had resolved to ask him.', \"'And why isn't it hers now?' asked Irene.\", \"'She does not want it now,' said the king, looking grave.\", \"'Why doesn't she want it now?'\", \"'And when shall I see her?' asked the princess.\", \"'Not for some time yet,' answered the king, and the tears came into his eyes.\", 'Irene did not remember her mother and did not know why her father looked so, and why the tears came in his eyes; but she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and asked no more questions.', \"'You forget yourself, my dear!' said the king.\", \"'By a hole in the mountain.'\", \"'One will be quite sufficient,' said Curdie.\", 'He must have slept a long time, for when he awoke he felt wonderfully restored--indeed almost well--and very hungry.  There were voices in the outer cave.', 'Once more, then, it was night; for the goblins slept during the day and went about their affairs during the night.', 'Curdie listened, and soon found that they were talking of himself.', \"'I was about to say,' she resumed, 'that it does seem a pity to waste so much fresh meat.'\", 'The king gave a great laugh.', \" 'I really cannot bear it,' said the queen.  'If I could only get at his horrid toes with my slippers again!'\", \"'I think we had better go to bed,' said the king.\", \"'It's not time to go to bed,' said the queen.\", \"'I would if I was you,' said Curdie.\", \"   'Go to bed,   Goblin, do.   Help the queen   Take off her shoe.\", \" 'What a lie!' roared the queen in a rage.\", \"'I will not,' said the queen.\", \"'So am I,' said the king.\", \"'Come along, then,' said the queen; 'and mind you are good, or I'll--'\", 'She had got about half-way down when she started, and nearly fell with fright.  Close to her ears as it seemed, a voice broke out singing:', \"'Why, you were singing loud!' said Irene.\", \"'Yes.  But they know I am here, and they don't know you are.  Who are you?'\", \"'I'm Irene,' answered the princess.  'I know who you are quite well. You're Curdie.'\", \"'Why, how ever did you come here, Irene?'\", \"'My great-great-grandmother sent me; and I think I've found out why. You can't get out, I suppose?'\", \"'No, I can't.  What are you doing?'\", \"'My grandmother sent me after her thread.'\", \"'I don't know what you mean,' said Curdie; 'but so you're there, it doesn't much matter.'\", \"'Oh, yes, it does!' returned Irene.  'I should never have been here but for her.'\", 'And Irene went to work, as fresh as when she began.', \"'How far on have you got?' asked Curdie.\", \"'What do you mean?' exclaimed Curdie. 'You will see when you get out,' answered the princess, and went on harder than ever.\", \"Irene got off the heap, and stood on one side of it.  'Now, Curdie!' she cried.\", \"'Oh, no, it's quite easy,' said Irene.  'We have only to follow my thread.  I am sure that it's going to take us out now.'\", \"'Where are you going there?' he cried.  'That's not the way out. That's where I couldn't get out.'\", \"'I know that,' whispered Irene.  'But this is the way my thread goes, and I must follow it.'\", 'And when he turned the next corner there she stood waiting for him.', \"'I knew you couldn't go wrong in that narrow hole, but now you must keep by me, for here is a great wide place,' she said.\", \"'I can't understand it,' said Curdie, half to himself, half to Irene.\", \"'That's all nonsense,' said Curdie.  'I don't know what you mean.'\", \"'Of course not,' returned the princess.  'But why do you think we shall be safe?'\", \"'There might be ways round,' said the princess.\", \"'But what do you mean by the king and queen?' asked the princess. 'I should never call such creatures as those a king and a queen.'\", \"'But how ever did Lootie come to let you go into the mountains alone?'he asked.\", \"'But how did you find your way to me?' persisted Curdie.\", \"'You don't mean you've got the thread there?'\", 'Curdie was too polite to say he did not believe there was any thread there at all.  What he did say was:', \"'Well, I can make nothing of it.'\", \"'I can, though, and you must be glad of that, for it will do for both of us.'\", \"'It goes into the ground now, Curdie,' she said, stopping.\", \"'What is that noise?' she asked.  'Do you know, Curdie?'\", \"'And you don't know what they do it for?'\", \"'No; I haven't the least idea.  Would you like to see them?' he asked, wishing to have another try after their secret.\", \"'Very well.  Shall I go in first?' said Curdie.\", \"'No; better not.  You can't feel the thread,' she answered, stepping down through a narrow break in the floor of the cavern. 'Oh!' she cried, 'I am in the water.  It is running strong--but it is not deep, and there is just room to walk.  Make haste, Curdie.'\", 'He tried, but the hole was too small for him to get in.', \"'There!--don't you see it shining on before us?' she added.\", \"'I don't see anything,' persisted Curdie.\", \"'I couldn't have done it but for the thread,' persisted Irene.\", \"'That's the part I don't understand.'\", \"'Well, come along, and Lootie will get you something to eat.  I am sure you must want it very much.'\", \"'Very well, Curdie; but you can't get out without coming this way, and I will take you through the house, for that is nearest.'\", 'They met no one by the way, for, indeed, as before, the people were here and there and everywhere searching for the princess.  When they got in Irene found that the thread, as she had half expected, went up the old staircase, and a new thought struck her.  She turned to Curdie and said:', \"'My grandmother wants me.  Do come up with me and see her.  Then you will know that I have been telling you the truth.  Do come--to please me, Curdie.  I can't bear you should think what I say is not true.'\", \"'Come in,' answered the sweet voice of her grandmother, and Irene opened the door and entered, followed by Curdie.\", 'As she spoke she took the little princess in her arms and placed her upon her lap.  She was dressed in white now, and looking if possible more lovely than ever.', \"'Yes, grandmother.  But it wasn't very good of him not to believe me when I was telling him the truth.'\", \"'I don't know that,' replied her grandmother.\", \"'Don't see my grandmother, when I'm sitting in her lap?' exclaimed the princess.\", \"'Don't you see the lovely fire of roses--white ones amongst them this time?' asked Irene, almost as bewildered as he.\", \"'Then what do you see?' asked Irene, who perceived at once that for her not to believe him was at least as bad as for him not to believe her.\", \"'And what more do you see?'\", \"'But don't you hear my grandmother talking to me?' asked Irene, almost crying.\", \"'No.  I can't, and I can't help it,' said Curdie, turning to leave the room.\", \"'You must give him time,' said her grandmother; 'and you must be content not to be believed for a while.  It is very hard to bear; but I have had to bear it, and shall have to bear it many a time yet.  I will take care of what Curdie thinks of you in the end. You must let him go now.'\", \"'No, Curdie; my grandmother says I must let you go.  Turn to the right when you get to the bottom of all the stairs, and that will take you to the hall where the great door is.'\", \"'Yes; but I should have thought Curdie--'\", \"'Yes, grandmother.  I must be fair--for if I'm not fair to other people, I'm not worth being understood myself.  I see.  So as Curdie can't help it, I will not be vexed with him, but just wait.'\", \"'If I had been there, Curdie would have seen me well enough.  But why should I be there rather than in this beautiful room?'\", \"'I thought you would be spinning.'\", 'The lady set her down and rose and went to the fire.  Putting in her hand, she drew it out again and held up the shining ball between her finger and thumb.', \"'Oh, thank you, grandmother! I feel so safe now!'\", 'The lady pressed her once more to her bosom, saying:', \"'Do not be afraid, my child.'\", \"'Now I am going to put you to bed for a good sleep,' said her grandmother.\", \"'There is just one thing more,' said Irene.  'I am a little anxious about Curdie.  As I brought him into the house, I ought to have seen him safe on his way home.'\", \"'I took care of all that,' answered the lady.  'I told you to let him go, and therefore I was bound to look after him.  Nobody saw him, and he is now eating a good dinner in his mother's cottage far up in the mountain.'\", \"'Then I will go to sleep,' said Irene, and in a few minutes she was fast asleep.\", \"'Now, Curdie,' his mother said, as they sat at supper, 'tell us the whole story from beginning to end, just as it all happened.'\", \"Curdie obeyed, and told everything to the point where they came out upon the lawn in the garden of the king's house.\", \"'And what happened after that?' asked his mother.  'You haven't told us all.  You ought to be very happy at having got away from those demons, and instead of that I never saw you so gloomy.  There must be something more.  Besides, you do not speak of that lovely child as I should like to hear you.  She saved your life at the risk of her own, and yet somehow you don't seem to think much of it.'\", \"'What were they?' asked his father.  'Your mother may be able to throw some light upon them.'\", 'Then Curdie made a clean breast of it, and told them everything.', \"'You confess, my boy,' she said, 'there is something about the whole affair you do not understand?'\", \"'Yes, of course, mother,' he answered.  'I cannot understand how a child knowing nothing about the mountain, or even that I was shut up in it, should come all that way alone, straight to where I was; and then, after getting me out of the hole, lead me out of the mountain too, where I should not have known a step of the way if it had been as light as in the open air.'\", \"'Then you have no right to say what she told you was not true.  She did take you out, and she must have had something to guide her: why not a thread as well as a rope, or anything else?  There is something you cannot explain, and her explanation may be the right one.'\", \"'It's no explanation at all, mother; and I can't believe it.'\", \"'But what I am going to tell you is very strange,' persisted his mother; 'and if having heard it you were to say I must have been dreaming, I don't know that I should have any right to be vexed with you, though I know at least that I was not asleep.'\", \"'Do tell me, mother.  Perhaps it will help me to think better of the princess.'\", \"'If I had only been with you!' cried father and son in a breath.\", \"'It's exactly as your mother told it to me the very next morning,' said his father.\", \"'But princesses have told lies as well as other people,' said Curdie.\", \"'I am sorry now,' answered Curdie.\", \"'You ought to go and tell her so, then.'\", \"'Have you, indeed, my boy?' said Peter.  'I am sure you deserve some success; you have worked very hard for it.  What have you found out?'\", \"'It's difficult, you know, father, inside the mountain, especially in the dark, and not knowing what turns you have taken, to tell the lie of things outside.'\", \"'Oh, Curdie,' cried his mother, 'then they will see you.'\", \"'I'm no more afraid of them now than I was before,' rejoined Curdie, 'now that I've got this precious shoe.  They can't make another such in a hurry, and one bare foot will do for my purpose. Woman as she may be, I won't spare her next time.  But I shall be careful with my light, for I don't want them to see me.  I won't stick it in my hat.'\", \"'Go on, then, and tell us what you mean to do.'\", \"'And what if you should?  How much wiser will you be then?'\", \"'I see what you are driving at now,' said his mother.\", \"'And I fancy,' said Curdie, 'if they once got her, they would tell the king they would kill her except he consented to the marriage.'\", \"'You must mind and keep out of the way of the men on the watch,' said his mother.\", \"'You naughty, naughty little princess!' cried Lootie.\", \"'I didn't do that, Lootie,' said Irene, very quietly.\", \"'I shall tell you nothing at all,' said Irene.\", \"'That's just as bad,' said the nurse.\", \"'Just as bad to say nothing at all as to tell stories?' exclaimed the princess.  'I will ask my papa about that.  He won't say so. And I don't think he will like you to say so.'\", '\\'When I tell you the truth, Lootie,\\' said the princess, who somehow did not feel at all angry, \\'you say to me \"Don\\'t tell stories\": it seems I must tell stories before you will believe me.\\'', \"'You are very rude, princess,' said the nurse.\", \"'You are so rude, Lootie, that I will not speak to you again till you are sorry.  Why should I, when I know you will not believe me?' returned the princess.  For she did know perfectly well that if she were to tell Lootie what she had been about, the more she went on to tell her, the less would she believe her.\", 'Every one stared at these words.  Up to this moment they had all regarded her as little more than a baby.', \"'I do not think my papa would wish me to have a nurse who spoke to me as Lootie does.  If she thinks I tell lies, she had better either say so to my papa, or go away.  Sir Walter, will you take charge of me?'\", \"'It's a boy!' cried several of them together, in a tone of amazement. 'I thought it was one of those demons.  What are you about here?'\", \"'Why, what else could he be?' said one.\", \"'Let me go away, then, if you please,' said Curdie.\", \"'But we don't please--not except you give a good account of yourself.'\", \"'I don't feel quite sure whether I can trust you,' said Curdie.\", \"'I was about no mischief,' said Curdie.\", \"In a moment the goblin royal family and the whole goblin people were on their way in hot haste to the king's house, each eager to have a share in the glory of carrying off that same night the Princess Irene.\", \" The Goblins in the King's House\", \"'Now then, I will!' he said.

I ought to have helped it before.'\", \"'Why can't you help it now?'\", \"'Then you've come from my house, have you?'\", \"'I didn't know you were there.'\", \"'And I never knew it!  Then perhaps you can tell me why my grandmother has brought me here?  I can't think.  Something woke me--I didn't know what, but I was frightened, and I felt for the thread, and there it was!  I was more frightened still when it brought me out on the mountain, for I thought it was going to take me into it again, and I like the outside of it best.
